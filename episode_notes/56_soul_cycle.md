Soul Cycle
===
### Intro
> SoulCycle is a New York City-based fitness company founded in 2006. It offers indoor cycling (Not to be confused with "spinning") workout classes.
* You rent a pair of shoes the clip into the bike, and for about an hour bike a LOT in a low lit room with an inspirational instructor
* There is a knob that controls how hard you're pedaling, and you adjust this throughout the workout
* As of June 2018, SoulCycle has 88 studios in the United States and Canada.

### Culture
* A huge part of this culture - its fucking HARD

* Quotes from Vox
  > [SoulCycle has been labeled been labeled] a cult, an obsession, even therapy
  > The key to SoulCycle is that it isn't so difficult that it makes you feel like a failure five minutes in, but it's tough enough to leave you gasping for air.

* Teamwork
  * So it's not _real_ teamwork, but you are doing something very taxing and hard with others, which builds bonds
  * Unlike other workout classes, you are working out _to_ the music - so everyone is perfectly synchronized
  * Some feel that gyms and workout programs like SoulCycle are becoming church for a younger generation

* Teachers
  * Teachers go through a 10 week training program to make sure they're teaching in line with the company's values
  * The teacher is a huge part of the experience; students will often become devotees to their favorite

* Competition
  * There is a slight competitive aspect
    * More advanced people sit in the front, newbies in the back
    * The front row people are the ones who everyone else follows
    * Some will come 20 minutes early to claim the front row spot
    * This is something that some studnts obsess over
      * NYT:
        * Interview with avid student Greccia Clausen,
          > "When there’s people in front of me, it gets in the way of my workout, I won’t ride if I don’t get the front row."
        > At a sold-out and wait-listed New Year’s Day morning class at Flywheel Sports in the Flatiron district, the instructor Jesse Alexander urged those in front to pick up the pace. “You go faster, we go faster,” yelled Mr. Alexander, one of the studio’s top draws. “This is the foundation for your year.”


* Price
  * SoulCycle sells $54 tank tops that say "FRONT ROW"
  * A SoulCycle class costs between $30 and $40 depending on your area
  * Price alone is a huge motivator

### Conclusion
* Some people think the cycling bubble is about burst
  * One of the founders of SoulCycle also started a competitor, Flywheel
  * And others:  Crank, Swerve, Revolve, Monster, BYKlyn, and Cyc, CycleBar

* It's clear why this is a thing - it's an intense workout that gets you hooked
* How long will it last?
