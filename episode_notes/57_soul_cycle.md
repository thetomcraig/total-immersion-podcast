### Culture
* Vox
  > [SoulCycle has been labeled been labeled] a cult, an obsession, even therapy
  > To many sane, logical people paying $30 ($34 if you live in New York City) for a class where you ride a stationary bike for 45 minutes is a sign of mental illness â€” or perhaps a signal that you may be susceptible to fanatical behavior
  > The key to SoulCycle is that it isn't so difficult that it makes you feel like a failure five minutes in, but it's tough enough to leave you gasping for air.

> "One thing I love about SoulCycle is that the instructors don't yell at you. I hate that feeling when you drag yourself to go work out, only to have an instructor tell you you're not trying hard enough," says Marisa Kabas, a freelance writer and a SoulCycle enthusiast. "At Soul they let you do your thing, which oddly makes me want to work harder."
