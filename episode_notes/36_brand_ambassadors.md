## Part 1/2 Instagram et. all
### Brand Ambassador
* Person who is hired to represent a brand; show it off
* This person should embody the corporate identity
  * Questlove
* This has been around forever, but w/ internet it's become cheaper and easier for anyone to be an abassador
* Instagram has made it possible to reverse the process
  * Rather than companies picking people like celbrities, individuals can prove themselves (to the brand) worthy of being ambassadors
  * There is an art and a set of rules to doing this
    * Consistently posting quality, relavant, cohesive content
    * Using the right hashtags and descriptions
    * Promoting yourself just enough (name, contact info, etc)
    * Hyrbid promotion (hashtags on business cards, etc)
    * Know your audience and hwo to target sections
    * Join an influencer network
* Influencer Network??
  * These services let you apply to become a brand ambassador
* Once you're on board you have to post in the fashion dictated by the brand/company that's paying you


### Social Media Influencer
* Also called "influencer marketing"
* For each dollar spent on influencer marketing, marketers see an average of $7.65 in earned media value returned.
* Very similar to Brand Ambassador, but more about swaying large sections of social media users
* Not tie to a specific brand or product or company
* Things can be more subtle - product in the background, or combinations of things, or pic at a resturant
  * Definitely is some skill in doing this "right" (lots of likes/follows)
* Implication here is that these are more "real people" than Brand Ambassadors.
  * It's similar, but comes off as more genuine

### Conclusion
* This is whack
* The social media influencer system seems cery destructive to me
  * Supposed to be more personal, genuine, but the likelihood of you discovering is based on how many followers the
    person has
  * More followers makes them more credible, and leads to even more followers
  * Lots of followers leads to more brand associations
  * More brand associations leads to a more broad persona
  * Broad persona leads to higher chance of disperate people wanting to follow i.e. more followers
  * BUT wouldn't a really broad range of interests make someone seemm less genuine?
  * There's a tipping point for how broad you can be vs. niche - go over and you've "sold out"
* So many new roles and jobes and shit
  * I saw this one on the Bachelorete - `Social Media Participant`
