Uber
===

#### What is this
Uber is the ride sharing app

#### Background/General info
##### Terms
* Pax: Short for Passenger.
* Ping: The noise the app makes when drivers receive a pickup request.
* Fare: The fee a rider is charged.
* Fair: Fare, spelled wrong.
* Surge: Uber occasionally up-charges riders during times of increased demand. The Surge is a multiplier of the base fare rate.
* SRF: "Safe Rider Fee", now known as the "Booking Fee". This is the $1-3 fee that Uber adds to every fare to cover insurance, app fees, etc.

##### Payment
* Uber Pays weekly, after taking out their cut
* In cities like SF you can do it as a full time job, but not for less dense places.
* Driver's often pull a line like "Ill tip you in the app" for small favors.  Then don't

##### Complaints
* Cannot see a rider's destination
* Very unpredictable when you'll be called and what the passenger will be like
* Uber car leasing
  > The loans offered from the Uber providers are extremely high interest and require weekly payments.
* Uber support is shit
  >  Well, it’s very standoffish. They’re not very easy to get a hold of. Everything that we do is via email. A lot of the questions that we’ll ask may be dealing with specific things, and you’ll get back a canned response, multiple times.

  > I'm beginning to feel more and more that we are treated as an expendable and infinitely renewable resource for Uber, and that when we eventually do get deactivated, that there are 10 more fresh fish ready to take our place.
>It’s mostly tedious mixed with a little interest and a very slight satisfaction.
>Some are slobs, some are not. Some are helpful, some aren't. Most are silent and play on their cell phones (which I prefer them to do). A few sit in front, most sit in back. Very few riders are memorable. Very few drives are memorable. At the end of day, after maybe 15 trips, it’s all a blur. A day of hauling freight around.

##### Things of Note
* They can see _some_ comments
* They have to rate passengers, but passenger ratings are optional
* Passengers are  not educated on the rating system:
  > Basically you’re expected to get a 4.6 average, and if you go below that, you’ll get a warning before they quickly deactivate you.
* Poorly rated drivers can be deactivated (Anything under 4)
  * And its suggested you keep a score of about 4.6
* No consensus on whether it's "worth it"
  * Some drivers love it, some hate it

#### The Community and People
* People chat online, tell stories about driving
* Really appreciate good passengers
* Riders say people prefer Uber to taxis
* Drivers say passengers look at their phones for most rides

#### Conclusion
* Overall more positive than I thought, but still a mixed bag.

##### Tom's Opinion
* Do not want
