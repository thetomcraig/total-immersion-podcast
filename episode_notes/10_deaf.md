10 - Deaf
===
Interaction with deaf people
====
    * You don’t know if someone is deaf a face to face conversation
    * Lack of awareness

Three views of deafness
====
    1. Medical view - deafness is a problem to be fixed by surgery
    2. Social view - Welcome deaf people into greater society and provide accommodation
    3. Cultural Linguistic view - Deaf culture is a minority culture with its own language, norms, customs and should be protected
        * deaf/Deaf
            * deaf - inability to hear.
            * Deaf - the entire culture of people who identify with Deafness, because of varying levels of hearing ability
            * deaf people proud of their culture, some deaf people don’t like this
            * Some appose cochlear implants in children:
                * Why should they have to adapt to a society that does not accept them?
                * This is not a “problem” that needs to be “fixed”
                * Ability to learn language rapidly decreases with age
                    * Imperative that children get the implants because not as effective in adults
                        * The average reading level of deaf 17- and 18-year-olds is at the fourth grade level

Over 200 distinct sign languages
====
    * ASL (not age sex location)
    * And French Sign Language
    * Many others

I walked/worked with white noise
====
    * Focus was easier
    * Less anxiety
    * Amplification of other senses (almost immediately)
        * Watching cars closely
        * Deaf people are good drivers
        * Traffic (my lyft driver)
    * Some things no longer bothered me
        * Don’t care if someone says “thanks” - I can’t hear it
        * Easier to meditate - lol
    * I quickly became used to it
        * I’m always listening to something; music, book, podcast
        * Feel like I should always be taking advantage of down time
        * Both with no hearing - who cares?
    * Subconsciously we associate noises and learn to filter them out
        * When something “sounds off” we get suspicious
        * With no sound - less on guard
        * But can’t rely on hearing a car or a biker, etc
            * So also more on guard in a way

Things you would not normally think about
====
    * Romance
    * It’s harder if you’re a people-person
        * Patience required from friends are can hear
        * Online interaction is a godsend
    * No ability/reduced ability to get “incidental learning” i.e. picking up on stuff around you
    * Captions at the movie theaters suck
    * Often showing up early to events
    * Alarms - Vibrating pillows

So - completely different world
====
    * Cant say better/worse, just different
    * You can get used to anything
    * People interviewed did not wish to have hearing
