===

### What's this all about & History
* Genealogists are people who research their own/others' families to construct a narratives, charts, etc that tell the
  story of the family's history
* The Society of Genealogists says:
  * `Genealogy` is the "establishment of a Pedigree by extracting evidence, from valid sources, of how one generation is connected to the next" 
  * `Family History` is "a biographical study of a genealogically proven family and of the community and country in which they lived".

### Process
* Genealogists use these methods to obtain info:
  * Oral interviews
  * Historical records
  * Online message baords and mailing lists
    * Used to find relatives, requst record lookups, get research advice, etc
    * Genealogists will prepare indexes of names and publish them for others to use
  * Genetic analysis
    * Three DNA types of interest when comparing
      * mitochondrial DNA - every has it; comes from mother
      * Y-chromosome - only males have it; passed down from father
      * autosomal DNA - found in 22 non-gender specific chromosomes; comes from mother and father
    * Test can look at all of this and give a likelihood of relation between people
  * Vairious other records include:
    * Birth records
    * Death records
    * Marriage and divorce records
    * Adoption records
    * Census records
    * City directories[23] and telephone directories

    * Emigration, immigration and naturalization records
    * Land and property records, deeds
    * Medical records
    * Occupational records
    * Oral histories
    * Ship passenger lists

* They construct some of the following things:
  * Pedigree chart - diagram that shows occurence and appearance or phenotypes of particular genes/organisms and the
    ancestors through time
    * Lots of specific nomeclature and symbols
      * Markings for sex of offspring, and `heterozygotes` <- HS biology quiz!

* Similar to a cop researching a crime
  * Need to build evidence and construct a narrative, many moving and interlocking parts
### Why do this?
* How do I/my family fit into the bigger historical picture?
* Lots of individuals just curious
* Family medical histories with families with serious medical conditions that are hereditary.
* Some professionals will do this work for biographies, big companies
  * Lots of connotation here concerning pharmaceuticals and insurance...
  * Often genealogists will specialize e.g. `Scottish Clan`, or a single surname (one-name study), or a small community, or a famous person

### Communities/People
* Aforementioned mailing lists and boards
* The Society of Genealogists (SoG) is a UK-based educational charity, founded in 1911 to "promote, encourage and foster the study, science and knowledge of genealogy"
* Family history plays a part in the practice of some religious belief systems. 
  * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has a doctrine of baptism for the dead, which necessitates that members of that faith engage in family history research.
* In US, Australia, etc ther is a growing pride in the pioneers and nation-builders. 
  * Establishing descent from these was impressive/cool.  For ex. the Daughters of the American Revolution.
* From a family perspective
  * Findings can help celebrate the resilience of families that survived generations of poverty or slavery
  * Also celebrate the success of families in integrating across racial or national boundaries.
  * Some family histories even emphasize links to celebrity criminals, Al Capone, Jim Jones etc...
* `Bloodlines of Salem` - a Salt Lake City-based family-history group.
  * Purpose is to provide a "place where visitors share ideas and information about the Salem witch trials of 1692, its participants and their families."

### Internet

  * According to some sources, genealogy is one of the most popular topics on the Internet
  * Porn must be no. 2??
