Stans
===

### What's this all about
- People who are realy big fans and celebrities
- Often female pop stars
> Stans aren't just superfans, they're a community of like-minded souls coming together, unified under the banner of wanting to see their chosen celebrity flourish. Friendships are made, bonding over a shared love of an artist, their work, their achievements. --Huffpo
- Stan can be a noun or verb

### Origins
- Fans have always existed (obvi)
- "Stan" comes from the 2000 era Eminem song "Stan"
  - The song is about a guy named "Stan" who is an Eminem super fan who sends letters to Eminem and eventually ties up
    Eminem's girlfried in his car and drives them into a river killing both
- Also been called a portmanteau of "stalker" and "fan"

### What makes a superfan?
- Similar to the traditional idea of obsession
- Difference here is the internet, so chance for larger and more dynamic community

#### Obsession
- Similar to addition
- Fascination with a single thing - person, place, etc
- Makes us feel purpose
- Leads to neglect of other parts of our life
- Losing the object of obsession is devistating as we have linked it with happinesso
- Obesssing over something is similar to 'rumination'
  - Cycle, and stress inducing
- We have the propensity for obsession and rumination

- My theory
  - Like religion and sports and others, we like to submit to a higher power
  - Celebrites are higher powers
  - With the www, we can feel like they're actually _talking_ to us
    - We get new info and maybe a back and forth; it's dynamic

#### Other characteristics
- `Stanning` is the term tht refers to actively being a stan for someone famous
  - Could mean you follow all their online posts
  - Read up on them, wikipedia, tabloids, etc
  - Maybe fanfic, tattoos, etc

### Internet
- Twitter
  - Subcultures exist within Twitter for various stans
  - Have their own words, phrases etc
  - Waring factions... more on that in a sec
  - People posting art, memes, pictures
  - Total shitshow

  - Stuff I found incomprehensible
  > First of all, I don't really like ninja music. Now before you act all offended, I would never (publicly) call any Black person a ninja, I’m just saying that Beyoncé usually makes ninja music. R&B/urban/Black people music has never made much sense to me; it's just a bunch of hollering, jungle noises and drums as far as I'm concerned (Attention all R&B artists: You're not in Africa anymore. Please call Dr. Luke! NOW!). I guess Beyoncé thinks she’s too good to use the same overused beats, sounds and producers as her peers, but I don’t see the point in releasing music for any purpose other than going Top 5 on the Hot 100 or appeasing Caucasian bottoms and 12 year olds. Let me just be clear, I don’t completely hate Black music or Black artists. I’ll listen to Black music if it’s performed by White Artists (Adele, Eminem, Amy Winehouse) and I’ll listen to Black artists as long as they are performing European-inspired music, but I don't really care for most of Beyoncé's discography. See, when I'm looking for songs to twerk my taint to, I want less "Treat me with respect and put a ring on it" and more "Fuck me raw and text me when you feel like it".
