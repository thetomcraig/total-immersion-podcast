4 - Ask Men
===
1. Redditors are obviously men over 30
    1. 20,920 dudes and curious ladies
    2. Most are 30ish, some older people who give advice
2. Related to r/askmen - so this is whats going on in askmen:
    1. Discussions of men+men and men+women relationships
        1. I’ve read about this: very different modes of time-spending
        2. In group settings this can get interesting as groups of friends interact
    2. Good post: “How do I talk to my son?”
    3. Interesting post: “How do you know if you are bad person?”
    4. Discussion of porn
    5. Discussion about what the fuck beauty products do andor are called
    6. Dealing with body hair
    7. Lots of humorous joke/posts
    8. Assorted stories…
Okay, so that's the “ask men” feel, what about over 30?
1. Post about friendship -> men don’t like peeing next to each other
    1. Feels same as “ask men”
2. Posts question more what life is about and how to be happy
    1. Responses are longer too, and have more anecdotes
3. People know themselves better… Makes me wonder what ask men over 40 would have?
4. I like this guys summary in his question on the sub:
1. Invest your money because the government and taxes and the cost of life will screw you and take all your money.
2. Stretch and eat right because age will screw you and suddenly steal away your physical health.
3. Don't invest too much time money and emotions into women because the false idea of 'true love' will screw you.

5. This got me thinking about maturity in general
    1. I usually think about it as a 1 dimensional spectrum, but its more complex
    2. People mature in different ways, and there are so many things to be mature about
    3. For example, asking a question about how to get a “manly” tattoo…
        1. “If you need to ask what is manly at age 45, you need to do some work, brother.”
6. Really interesting top post abut a guy who feels “numb”
    1. Discussion over whether he has clinical depression or not
    2. This really got me questioning how communication over the internet can be misconstrued and or dangerous
        1. This guy may actually need help, and I worry that he’ll settle for just asking reddit
        2. Holy shit this is deeper than hats
7. Ending question: what does it mean to be a man, and an adult?
    1. What does Manhood mean today?  What does it look like?.
