Zero Wasters
===
### Intro
> Zero Waste is a philosophy that encourages the redesign of resource life cycles to that all products are reused.  
> The goal is for no trash to be sent to landfills, incinerators, or the ocean.  
-- Wikipedia
* This emphasizes the consideration of waste early on in the life cycle of production
  * For example, designing something out of compostable materials, using less packaging, etc
* It's important to note that "zero waste" is more of an ideal than a target
  * Today is just about impossible to produce something at scale that involves NO waste
* Quick maffs
  * American throws out approximately 4.4 pounds per day
* WHY?
  * Saving money, decreasing pollution, reducing cost needed for raw materials
  * Health - less scary stuff getting into the air/water
    * Household chemicals and prescription drugs often thrown out with the rest of the garbage
  * ALSO, we're reaching carrying capacity for the earth... only so many raw resources exist
* Product life cycles
  * Traditional model - "Cradle to Grave"
    * Raw materials are used to produce something, eventually the product is disposed of in a landfill
  * Newer model - "Cradle to Cradle"
    * Same, but at the end of a product's life, it becomes a resource for NEW products

### History
* Industrial Revolution
  * America starts to product products at SCALE
  * Obviously, this happens other places in the world too
* 1998 - 2000
  * Movement and ideals become mainstream
  * Starts to move "from theory to action"
  * Emphasis on a "zero waste community"
* 2001
  * California Integrated Waste Management Board establishes a "zero waste goal"
* 2002
  * City and County of San Francisco’s Department of the Environment also establishes this goal
* 2010 
  * San Francisco reaches a record-breaking 80% diversion rate
* 2012 - Today
  > The world generates at least 3.5 million tons of plastic and other solid waste a day, 10 times the amount a century ago 
  * Also worth noting here that landfills are disproportionately located in areas of low socioeconomic status
  > Only 9 percent of all plastic waste on Earth has been recycled. Among all the adherents of the zero- and low-waste lifestyle I spoke to, the first and foremost tenet is preventing waste from existing in the first place.

  * Now this trend has become more mainstream, and even large brands are embracing it
### Culture
* Zero waste enthusiasts are often young millennial women
* People in this culture lead their personal lives in ways that reduce or eliminate waste
  * Sustainability
  * Recycling
  * Making things themselves
    * Deodorant, household cleaners, etc
* Tons of blogs, websites, etc
  * goingzerowaste.com
    * Trash is For Tossers
    * Contains articles such as:
      * "Why I wait 30 days before I make a purchase"
      * "Microplastics: What are they and what can we do about them?"
      * "5 Ways for you to join the sharing economy"
* Lots of "getting started" posts and articles with simple things you can do
  * For example:
    * Use a handkerchief instead of regular tissues
    * Start carrying a water bottle, rather than buying plastic water bottles
    * Use mesh bags for produce at the grocery store (or no bags at all!)
    * Wooden toothbrushes 
    * Start composting; separate food waste from your garbage
* Single mason jar
  * Common goal of zero waste folks is fitting their yearly waste into a single mason jar
* Community building
  * Through instagram, blogs, magazine articles, etc communities have been created around zero waste
  * Many who live this lifestyle also become involved in their communities, like going to recycling centers

* Five Principles from expert zero wasters
  1. Refuse - refuse to buy things with lots of packaging
  2. Reduce - don’t buy things you don’t really need
  3. Reuse - repurpose worn out items, shop for used goods, and purchase reusable products like steel water bottles
  4. Compost - up to 80 percent of waste by weight is organic. But this rarely decomposes in landfills
  5. Recycle – It still takes some energy and resources to recycle, but it’s better than sending stuff to the landfill or allowing it to become litter

### Criticism
* Some criticize the zero waste movement, saying it's not a universe guideline that can be applied to all products
  * For example, a bag made from tiger skin meet the zero waste criteria, but are NOT more ethical than single use plastic bags
* Also you can use resources for production that are compostable and non-toxic, but what if mining them releases more harmful chemicals into the atmosphere?
* It's also hard to know what part of the product life cycle should be targeted to make things more "zero waste"
  * For example, "difference between smashing a glass bottle (recovering cheap glass) and refilling the bottle
    (recovering the entire function of the container)."

### Conclusion
* This is HARD
  * We are ruled by convenience, so lots of stuff is packaged in single use containers
  * We tend to become desensitized, and used to the norm
    * Which, in America, is a lot of packaging
* Out of sight out of mind
* One has to be privileged to even be able to go zero waste
