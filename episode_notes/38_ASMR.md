ASMR
===

### What is this
Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response
> is an experience characterized by a static-like or tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine.  -- Wikipedia
> ASMR signifies the subjective experience of "low-grade euphoria" characterized by "a combination of positive feelings and a distinct static-like tingling sensation on the skin" -- Wikipedia

* The purpose is to achieve this feeling by experiencing audio-visual stimuli

* 2007-8 - Various groups created concerning this topic
  * Yahoo
  * Facebook
  * Reddit
* 2010 - Term Created in 2010
* Other names considered at the time:
  * Attention induced euphoria
  * Attention induced observant euphoria
  * Auditory induced head orgasm
    * Some didn't like this term because they felt ASMR was more relaxing and stimulating
    * By 2015 a division occurred concerning sexual arousal
      * Some people create videos atagoriazed as ASMRotica

### The ASMR Practice
* ASMR is precipitated by stimuli referred to as `triggers`; they can include:
  * Listening to a soft or whispering voice
  * Listening to a quiet, repetitive sounds from a mundane task like turning the pages of a book
  * Watching someone execute a mundane task
  * Loudly chewing, crunching, slurping, biting foods
  * Receiving altruistic tender personal attention
  * Listening to someone explain a concept, object, system

### Science/Rational
* We really don't know why this is a thing
  * No clinical trials or data
* Similar to `misophonia`
  > Literally means the 'hatred of sound', but manifests typically as 'automatic negative emotional reactions to particular sounds – the opposite of what can be observed in reactions to specific audio stimuli in ASMR' -- Wikipedia
  > [Some people experience] ASMR to some sounds, and misophonia in response to others. In one case, a subject reports that the sound of someone whispering can precipitate ASMR or misophonia depending on who is producing it.
  * Personally I feel like I have this in a major way
    * Often annoying sounds like chewing, etc cause me a lot of unease and anxiety

* Helps with lots of issues, but it's not really understood why
  * Sleep
  * Anxiety
  * Depression

### Communities
* YouTube
  * Lots of YouTube stars who make these videos 
    * ASMRtist
  * They're bad though, not much scientific data; brands are shooting in the dark
  * As of 2017 there are over 9 million ASMR videos on YouTube. 
* Reddit - r/asmr
  * Lots of posts of videos with people performing tasks and making sounds
  * Many tagged as "unintentional"
    * Seems like this is even more satisfying
  * Role play - Basically the person reading through a script
    * Doctor's appointment
  * Some examples:
    * ASMR - Eating Roast Beef Sandwich
    * (Deadjosey ASMR) Keyboard Typing [long]
    * Suit Fitting for a Gentleman [Intentional] [Roleplay][Male] [English Accent]
    * Tapping and Scratching on Wood [intentional][male][whispers]
    * Indian guy talking about his antique rosewater sprinkler [unintentional] [male] [soft speaking] [short] [close attention]

* This has become mainstream 
  * Lots of brand use ASMR in their ads
    * ASMRtists are often commissioned
  * Art installations

### Conclusion
* People have different reasons for doing this; it's prevalent enough to be working
  * Some people think its popular because we feel less connected with another today
* Bob Ross for example is an example of this appeal:
  >  In episodes of _The Joy of Painting_... his soft, gentle, altruistic speaking mannerisms and the sound of him painting and his tools trigger [the effects of ASMR] on many of his viewers -- Wikipedia

* This reminds me of knolling
  * Tightly organizing many small objects at right angles to one another
  * For example: disassembled iPhone
  * I _really_ like this... Not sure why.  What about you?
