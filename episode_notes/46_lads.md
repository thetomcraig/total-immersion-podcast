Lads
===
* Thanks to Libby for this idea

#### What is this/Background
* `Lad Culture`, or `laddish culture`, or `laddism`
* Subculture associated with Britpop
  * Which bolstered very pop-inspired rock music 
  * In response to Grunge in the US, and other similar, dark, music
    * Oasis, Blur, etc

#### History
* 1990s - Subculture came to prominence
  > It was that of a generally middle class figure espousing attitudes typically attributed to the working classes. 
  > The subculture involves young men assuming an anti-intellectual position, shunning sensitivity in favour of drinking, violence, and sexism

* 1993
  * Author Sean O'Hagan coined this term in an article in the men's magazine "Arena"
    > The postmodern transformation of masculinity ... the 1990s 'new lad' was a clear reaction to the 'new man'

    * He described this character as a "return to hegemonic masculine values of sexism and male homosociality"

* Today - Post-feminism
  * Lad culture is very related to this
  * Backlash against this idea of the modern man who has "subjugated his masculinity in order to fulfill the needs of women"
  * Some women are against this too - feeling like they want men to be more traditionally masculine

* This has become culture pretty ingrained in UK, with real adults claiming to be Lads
> Unfortunately lad culture is an intrinsic and subtle part of English culture, most pertinent in student life.


#### The Subculture 
* This was also seen as a response to feminism
  * Many men felt "humiliated" or "battered by feminism"
* Good examples of this culture can be found in Movies and TV
  * Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
  * Top Gear
  * Fantasy Football League

* "Uni Lad"
  * Very similar to "frat bro" culture in America
  * This has become so ingrained in universities that 

* This was so problematic that lots of writers, journalists, etc spent time writing and worrying about it
  * The NUS - The National Union of Students in UK
    * Held a summit on tackling the issue
    * Have a dedicated page on their website on how to tackle the issue

* "True Lads"
  * Even more specific than just "lads" or "uni lads"

#### Activities
* Good description from Vice article
  > Like the characters in Platoon, they were from no place in particular, going no place in particular; a generation of young men promised everything by New Labour and given nothing by the Big Society.

  One journalist described them as a "group of buffed-up sports science students in shutter shades... forcing beer
  funnels down everyone's throats and using the word 'gay' as a pejorative."

* Description of activities:
  * Binning Pints
    * Dirty Pint
      * Fucking dumb drinking game
  * Exposing genitalia and getting naked in public places
  * Throwing up after copious alcohol consumption
  * Spousal Abuse
  * Getting kicked out of pubs/nightclubs for being overly offensiveâ€™
  * Banter
      > Banter can be defined as the playful exchange of teasing remarks in a good-humoured manner. Unfortunately, a more sinister use of the word gets thrown around all too often as a means of masking derogatory comments and just waving them off as banter and a bit of harmless fun.
    * Sounds a lot like "locker room banter" (Trump)

* Websites
  * Lad Bible
    * 12th most popular website in the UK
      * Above the Guardian and Telegraph
      * Just below Twitter
  * Unilad
    * Like Lad Bible, this has become a very legitimate-seeming new sources
    * Posts like:
      * Brooklyn Nine-Nine is the best thing on TV
      * Grandad Salutes old nave commands after not seeing each other for 50 years
      * J.K. Rowling 'Confirms' Dark Harry Potter Fan Theory
      * CCTV camera captures terrifying 'ghost' on camera

#### Backlash Against the Culture
* Reddit - "Mad lads"
  * Satirizes them

* More and more movements against lads
  * Anti-lad movement
  * HeForShe
    * Founded be Emma Watson

##### Tom's Opinion
* Toxic masculinity
