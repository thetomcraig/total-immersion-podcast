Bronies
===

### What's this all about & History
* Grown men who are big fan of My Little Pony
* Franchise has been around since the '80s, but animated series created in 2010 - _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_
  * Lauren Faust was put in charge of this new rendition (worked on Power Puff Girls), because Hasbro felt like the
    brand was tanking
  * She created a more intelligent show similar to other cartoons/animated films that feature writing that appeal to adults and children
  * This caused resurgence of popularity among girls and adult men  

* Most men are "steriotypical" men
  > "I can build a custom motorcycle from scratch, can weld, and worked as a lube guy at a GM dealership,” Dustykatt says. “And on top of that, I watch a show for little girls."

    * Lots of people involved in the show actually embrace the bronies

#### Bronies themselves
* Just regular dudes
* _Very_ earnest love of the show
  * My Little Pony is not a "guilty pleasure"
* But these are the bronies we see on the news/internet
  * This is pretty common for lots of fan groups though
* Seems like they are very outspoken and pushy
  * Perhaps these are the ones we see most often

#### Criticism
* This is somehow immature
* Maybe indicitive of something wrong the the fans
* Maybe it serves some ulterior motive
* It's just... weird
* It comes down to a gender thing: this show is for _girls_

#### Conclusion
> We’re supposed to chug beer, ride motorcycles, be degrading to women, and like explosions. That’s what’s ingrained in our brains from the minute you’re born and put in a crib. Well, I like what I like. I don’t need society to tell me what I like. And that’s all there is to it.
* Why is there so much hate about this particular group?
  * It seems kind of rapey/pervy... But why?
    * Can we dig deeper than "its weird"?

* I watched an episode of this show... It was pretty normal
