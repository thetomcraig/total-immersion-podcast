Stans
===

### What's this all about
- People who are realy big fans and celebrities
- Often female pop stars
> Stans aren't just superfans, they're a community of like-minded souls coming together, unified under the banner of wanting to see their chosen celebrity flourish. Friendships are made, bonding over a shared love of an artist, their work, their achievements. --Huffpo

### Origins
- Fans have always existed (obvi)
- "Stan" comes from the 2000 era Eminem song "Stan"
  - The song is about a guy named "Stan" who is an Eminem super fan who sends letters to Eminem and eventually ties up
    Eminem's girlfried in his car and drives them into a river killing both

### What makes a superfan?
- Similar to the traditional idea of obsession
- Difference here is the internet, so chance for larger and more dynamic community

#### Obsession
- Similar to addition
- Fascination with a single thing - person, place, etc
- Makes us feel purpose
- Leads to neglect of other parts of our life
- Losing the object of obsession is devistating as we have linked it with happinesso
- Obesssing over something is similar to 'rumination'
  - Cycle, and stress inducing
- We have the propensity for obsession and rumination

- My theory
  - Like religion and sports and others, we like to submit to a higher power
  - Celebrites are higher powers
  - With the www, we can feel like they're actually _talking_ to us
    - We get new info and maybe a back and forth; it's dynamic
