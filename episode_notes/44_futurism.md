Futurism
===
#### What is this/Background
> Futurism as an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century.

> It emphasized speed, technology, youth, and violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. 

> It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past. Cubism contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style.

* 1909 - Futurism founded by Italian Poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti 
  * Soon after publishing some columns he is joined by lots of painters and other artists

* There were parallel movements in other countries at this time; Russia, England, Belgium, etc
* Futurism is practice in **every** medium of art - even meals

#### Futurists themselves
* Futurists value the technological triumph of humanity over nature
* Strongly disavowed love of the past
* Dismissed art critics as useless
* Rebelled against harmony and good taste
* Oneness
  * Futurists believed that in objects reality were not separate from one other or their surroundings  
    > The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places. ... The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it.
  * Reminds me a lot of Zen Buddhism

#### Movements within Futurism
##### Futurist Painting
* Painting techniques were taken from several other styles
* Very dynamic and scientific, in how they decomposed forms and colors etc

##### Futurist Cooking
* Futurist movement recognized that people "think, dream and act according to what they eat and
  drink"
* Taken from the _Manifest of Futurist Cooking_, by Marinetti
  * Tenets of the food experience
    * No more pasta, as it causes lassitude, pessimism and lack of passion
    * Perfect meals requiring originality and harmony in table setting, including all implements, food aesthetics and tastes, and absolute originality in the food
    * Sculpted foods, including meats whose main appeal is to the eye and imagination
    * Abolition of the knife and fork
    * Use of perfumes to enhance the tasting experience
  * Tenets of food serving
    * Some food on the table would not be eaten, but only experienced by the eyes and nose
    * Food would arrive rapidly and contain many flavors, but only a few mouthfuls in size
    * All political discussion and speeches would be forbidden
    * Music and poetry would be forbidden except during certain intervals
* The _setting_ of the meal was also altered
  * One example was aviation themed:  
    > One of the proposed settings for these "perfect meals" incorporated the Futurist love of machinery. The diners would eat in a mock aircraft, whose engines' vibrations would stimulate the appetite. The tilted seats and tables would "shake out" the diners' pre-conceived notions, while their taste buds would be overwhelmed by highly original dishes listed on aluminium cards.
* Kitchen Implements
  * Kitchen equipment was replaced with scientific equipment to "bring modernity" to the kitchen
  * Examples of new kitchen equipment includes:
    * Ozonizers
      * to give food the smell of ozone
    * Ultraviolet ray lamps
      * to activate vitamins and other "active properties"
    * Electrolyzers
      * to decompose items into new forms and properties
    * Colloidal mills
      * to pulverize any food item
    * Autoclaves, dialyzers, atmospheric and vacuum stills
      * to cook food without destroying vitamins
    * Chemical indicators or analyzers
      * to help the cook determine if sauces need more salt, sugar, or vinegar
* Backlash
  * _Manifest of Futurist Cooking_ published in 1930 by Marinetti
  * Italian public and press had a field day
  * Doctors questioned on the pasta point
    * They recommended a varied diet, eating only pasta was fattening and not healthy
  * The Duke of Bovino, Mayor of Naples: "The angels in Paradise, eat nothing but vermicelli al pomodoro [fine spaghetti with tomato sauce]." 
  * Marinetti responds that this confirmed his suspicions about the monotony of Paradise.
* Marinetti very against foreign foods
* Some believe he was a fascist, obsessed with Nationalism

* Dishes include:
  * Italian Breasts in the Sunshine
  * Diabolical Roses
  * Divorced Eggs
  * Milk in a Green Light
  * Tactile Dinner

#### After Futurism
* Futurism is considered "extinct" as of 1944 due to the death of Marinetti
* Futurism influenced other art movements, e.g. Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, etc
  * Also something called "Neo-Futurism"
* Western Culture still heavily influenced by Futurism  
  > The emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture. 
* Ridley Scott consciously evoked futurist designs in Blade Runner
* Other subcultures have been influence, like Cyberpunk

##### Tom's Opinion
* Hilarious, but also interesting
* You can really see the influence even today
* Make you think about how you're shaped by society
