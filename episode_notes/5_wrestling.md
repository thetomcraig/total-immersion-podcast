1. What is this Reddit?
    1. They discuss all forms of Pro Wrestling;
        1. WWE - World Wrestling Entertainment
            1. RAW - live wrestling programming
            2. SmackDown - also live (airs a different night.)
            3. NXT - served as a development division, but has become very popular with fans.
        2. NJPW - New Japan Pro-Wrestling
            1. Second biggest wrestling promotion in the world behind WWE.

2. First Impressions:
    1. Wrestling is WAY more intensive and impressive then I thought.
    2. I thought it was always so obviously fake/scripted that it was lame.
        1. IT’S NOT LAME!

3. “Fake” or “Scripted”
    1. People always say that WWE is fake because it is scripted and thus isn’t a real sport because the winner is determined.
    2. WWE doesn’t claim to be a legitimate contest because it is scripted entertainment.

4. Who are the Redditors?
    1. Genuine fans, all 296,821 of them!
    2. Constantly referencing the long history and calling back to old players and matches.
