12 - Fantasy Football
===
* You make your draft based on players who all play in a real life league (NFL, Canadian, College)
* Two types of fantasy football
    * Traditional - amateurs, competition can run for an entire season or more than one
    * Daily - Contests can occur over a shorter period of time, weeks to days
        * These are managed by internet companies
        * Two big ones:
            * FanDuel
            * DraftKings
HISTORY
====
* "Modern fantasy football can be traced back to the late Wilfred "Bill the Gill" Winkenbach, an Oakland area businessman and a limited partner in the Oakland Raiders."
* In a New York hotel room during the 1962 Raiders eastern cross-country trip, he and public relations man Bill Tunnel and Tribune reported Scotty Stirling develop the rules.
* Inaugural league was called the GOPPPL (Greater Oakland Professional Pigskin Prognosticators League)
* The first draft took place in the rumpus room of Winkenbach's home in Oakland in 1963

    * Lots of discussion over charts that detail how well teams did, and talk about weather one should keep or drop a team
* Super strong and close
    * Guy accidentally asking for relationship advice actually got some - became the top post
        * "Ask your self this: if you drop her and she gets picked up by one of your leaguemates, will you be ok with that? She may continue to put up trash stats, but she may turn it around and make you regret this come playoffs."
* NFL drama - some discussion of Colin kaepernick and the taking a knee debate
* Strong community like sports fans can have this auxiliary community
    * Enhances and strengthens the enjoyment - neat
* What communities are this strong?  And why sports in particular?
    * Only profession i(or one of the few) in which you try to be the best in the world at what you do
