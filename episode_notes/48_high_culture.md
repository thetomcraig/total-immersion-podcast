High Culture
===

#### What is this/Background
> encompasses the cultural products of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as exemplary art.

> May also include intellectual works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and intellectual pursuits.

* Very much related to the culture of the upper class
* Often contrasted with something like "low culture", "mass culture", "popular culture"

> In European history, high culture was understood as a cultural concept common to the humanities

* This term came from a book _Culture and Anarchy_ (1869):
* It defines culture as "the disinterested endeavour after man’s perfection" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to "know the best that has been said and thought in the world.

* Art
    * Artworks considered part of High Culture - High Art - are likely those produced during periods of "high civilization"
      * "High Civilization" - "Large, sophisticated, and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework" for artist to work with
  * Means different things for different mediums
    * Film
      * "Art Film" - Made without the big movies companies (independently)
    * Music
      * "advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition"


#### Today's Culture and this Subculture 
* Many believe that there will always be something like this in society
  * For example T. S. Eliot said that high culture and popular culture are necessary and complementary parts of the culture of a society


* Origin 
  * The high culture of the West originated in the classical-world traditions of intellectual and aesthetic life in Ancient Greece (from c. 8th century BC – AD 147) and Ancient Rome (753 BC – AD 476).
  * Quote from Wikipedia: `The ideal mode of language was published and preserved in works of elevated style (correct grammar, syntax, and diction). Certain forms of language used by authors in valorized epochs were held up in antiquity and the Renaissance as eternal valid models and normative standards of excellence`
  * This quote itself seems to have been written by someone who is/wants to be in the High Culture

* In summary, this is all about intellect, rather than mechanical or technological endeavours

* Today 
  * How has this changed?
    * We still have a sense of classism, even if it's not called that
      * Capitalism will probably always allow for this
  * However, "High Culture" described here does not exist, at least in the USA today
    * For example - not many great painters out there
    * No sense of the "intelligensia" or the "aristocracy"
    * WHY?
      * Several theories
        * More global economy
          * You can get just about anything shipped anywhere
            * No sense of the higher classes only having access to certain commodities
        * More, easy access to information
          * Education is more easily accessible and affordable
          * Internet makes it easy to learn stuff cheaply/quickly
        * Differences in art
          * Lots more mediums for art now
            * Movies, TV, digital mediums, etc
          * Making art is less expensive
   * Do we have a parallel to this today?
    * Hipsterism
    * 1%ers, maybe?
