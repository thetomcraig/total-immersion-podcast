People/Community
====
    * Who?
        * Some people use them to replace a child they once lost
        * A child that has grown up
        * Some collect reborns as they would regular dolls.
        * People will play with them and take them shopping and shit
    * Internet really made the community blow up
    * “Adopting a doll"
        * The process of buying a reborn can be done to simulate an adoption process, rather than a prosaic sale of a product. As part of this, the dolls often come with fake birth certificates or adoption certificates.
* It’s an art form:
    * Passion for art
        * The doll should not be shiny.
    * Some artists open the nose, the holes should be correctly shaped, and the nails should be properly manicured.
* The International Reborn Doll Artists (IRDA) - Started in 2005
    * The IRDA group was assembled in order to offer education for improved skills in the art of reborn doll creation.
    *  A reborn artist can join the organization at any skill level, but members are asked to uphold a list of standards that were created by the IRDA's executive board. This ethical codestipulates the guidelines members are to follow in advertising, listing, and describing their dolls in order to divide credit fairly between manufacturers, sculptors, and artists.
Conferences, etc
====
    * International Reborn Doll Artists Conference
    * International IDEX Reborn Convention
    * Doll Reader Magazine

Process:
====
    * Doll is taken apart and factory paint is removed.
    * Eyes replaced.
    * Dozens of layers of flesh colored paint.
        * The doll parts may be heat set by baking them inside an oven after each layer of paint is applied.
    * Hair is inserted - “rooting”
        * This can take up to 30 or more hours per head
    * Body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets.
    * Other shit:
        * Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat
        * Devices that make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing 
        * umbilical cord
        * baby fat
        * heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch
        * voice boxes that mimic infant sounds
Conclusion
====
    * Uncanny Valley
        * Does this differ per person?  It must.  
        * Maybe there are other analogous things for men?  Is this just a biological imperative thing?
    * Is this healthy?  Some people think so.  Others think is detrimental
        * mothering a real newborn baby releases the hormone oxytocin in the mother, and hypothesizes that this may explain why "reborn mothers" become emotionally attached to the reborn baby doll
    * Mythical beings - wtf?
