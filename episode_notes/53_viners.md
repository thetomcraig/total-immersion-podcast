## Notes
### Intro

  * Twitter acquired it for a reported $30 million
* 2013
  * Launched by Twitter
  * Soon after launch they faced faced criticism for how they handled pornography (not at all)
    > While porn is not forbidden by Twitter's guidelines, one sexually explicit clip was accidentally featured as an "Editor's Pick" in the Vine app as a result of "human error".

    > Because pornographic content violates Apple's terms of service, the app's rating was changed to 17+ in February 2013 following a request by Apple.

    * No more uploads

    * App renamed "Vine Camera"
      * Still allowed recording and uploading only to Twitter
    * Twitter launches archive of all vine videos

#### Why did it die?
* Lot's of apps not have similar features

* Vine wasn't able to differentiate itself
* No way to make money

#### Culture
* People made a variety of vine videos

    > In March 2013, 22 Vines were presented in an exhibit entitled #SVAES (The Shortest Video Art Ever Sold) at the Moving Image art fair in New York City. Copies of the videos were available to purchase on thumb drives for US$200 each. Angela Washko's "Tits on Tits on Ikea" was sold to Dutch art advisor, curator and collector Myriam Vanneschi, during the event, marking the first ever sale of a Vine as art.

  * News
    > Following the shooting of Michael Brown in August 2014, then St Louis City Alderman Antonio French used Vine as a way to document the protests in Ferguson and the surrounding area. These videos were among the earliest accounts of the racial tensions in Ferguson, and helped bring national attention to the situation.

#### Legacy
* The internet is now scattered with links and pages that are stale or now show short, epitaphs
  * Vine app on Google Play now says this in the description:
    * "Dear Vine Community - thank you for all the inspiration, laughs, and loops.
    We have now placed Vine in an archived state. For more information, please visit https://vine.co"
  * Vine.co
    * Now only this sentence is visible:
      * "Dear Vine Community - thank you for all the inspiration, laughs, and loops. We have now
        placed Vine in an archived state. For more information, click here."
  * Twitter Help page now has info on the state of Vine
    * Epitaph:
      > In April of 2018, we moved the Vine Archive into a more static archived state to allow us to better preserve the public, creative expression of the Vine community.
    * Questions and answers here for those who are mourning Vine:
      * _Can I log in to Vine?_
        > We have removed the ability to log in to the Vine Archive. If you wish to delete your Vine account, you can let us know by emailing us at vinehelp@twitter.com with a link to your Vine profile page (i.e., https://vine.co/MyUserName).
      * _Can I download my Vines?_
        > You can no longer download your Vines. You can still view your Vines on the vine.co website through your browser.
      * Sampling of other questions:
        * _What happened to the Vine website?_
        * _What is on the Vine Archive?_
        * _What happened to the Vine Windows, XBox, and Vine Camera app?_
        * _Will my videos loop on Twitter?_
        * _Can I log in to Vine?_
        * _Can I delete my Vines?_
        * _I canâ€™t see my account, what happened?_
        * _Do Vines embedded on the web still work?_

* Vines exist in many other places now, because users have ported them over
  * YouTube montages
  * Twitter and FB posts

* Successor
  * In 2017 cofounder Dom Hofman announced he had started work on Vine's successor - "V2"
  * Similar but new and improved!
  * The videos would last between 2 and 6.5 seconds and would loop continuously. T
  * Hofman planned to launch mid-2018
  * Reports show that "Hofmann had already started reaching out to social media personalities in hopes to secure viral content for the new platform."
  * In May 2018, Hofman published a post on the V2 forum saying that V2 had been postponed
    indefinitely
    * Due to "financial and legal hurdles"
  * In November 2018, Hofmann announced the official name for 'v2' will be 'Byte'

### Conclusion
* Couple of interesting takeaways:
  * Short form of medium allowed people to become creative
    * Many vines referenced other vines, and became self-referential
  * Many have a very emotional connection to Vine
