Book Sellers
===
### Intro
- This is all about the collecting of books
- This could be considered a subset of _Antiquarianism_ which is a term for someone who is an aficionado of antiques or things of the past
- People who engage in bookselling are called booksellers, bookwomen, or bookmen
- People who collect books are called, "book collectors" I guess? Idk no cool name


### History
- 300 BC 
  - Founding libraries of Rome.
  - At this time it became fashionable to have a library, so Roman booksellers were the SHIT
- Later (Long time ago)
  - Spread of Christianity naturally lead to a HUGE demand for copies of the bible, Gospels, etc
- 16-17th centuries
  - Soon after the introduction of printing, what we consider to be "modern" bookselling came into being
  - At this time, the Low Counties were the chief capital of the bookselling world 
    - (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.)
- Modern times
  - Thanks to the I N T E R N E T, the modern bookselling world is vastly different than antiquity
  - Now we have lots of brick and mortar book stores that sell wide varieties or niche collections of books
  - Also lots of places online to buy and sell as well
  - One such niche category is _antiquarian books_

### Collecting Culture
- This is a very fraqmented subculture; actually more of a collection of subcultures
- For example, there may be collectors of books:
  - On a particular subject
  - Written by the same author, or from the same publisher
  - Published at the same time in history
  - That are considered "rare" for one reason or another
  - That are all first, or second edition

#### Rarity
- Books can be considered rare for a number or reasons
  - Not many copies published
  - Very old; not many copies still around
  - In good condition for their age
  - Weird shit like annotations made by the reader
- Examples:
  - _Catch-22_
    - First edition hard cover (pub. 1961)
    - Good condition
    - $14,000
  - _Catcher in the Rye_
    - First edition hard cover (pub. 1951)
    - Like New condition
    - $150
  - _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_
    - First edition hard cover (pub. 2000)
    - Like New condition 
    - $3,750
- Other rare as fuck books
  - Shakespeare's First Folio
    - Early printing of about 20 Shakespeare plays
    - There were probably about 750 printings of the original
    - 235 known surviving copies, mostly held in libraries and museums around the world
    - In 2003, the Oriel College in Oxford raised over $4 million from a sale of a first folio to Sir Paul Getty
      - (J Paul Getty's son)
  - Gutenberg Bible
    - a.k.a. "42-line bible", or "B42"
    - One of the first major books printed using mass-produced movable metal type in Europe
    - Started the "Gutenberg Revolution" (Major spread of printed material thanks to printing presses, in 17-18th centuries)
    - Estimated 49 copies exist
    - The last sale of one took place in 1978, for $2.2 million

#### Individual Collectors
- These can be anyone with enough means to purchase books for their collections
- There are levels; one can hold a collection worth tens to hundreds of dollars; rich people may have thousands or millions of dollars worth
- There is an art to collecting as an individual
  - You want to collect around some theme, but you can't have it be too broad or two narrow
  - For example, "World War II" is _way_ too broad
  - It's often that individuals will collect the works of a particular author, or combination of categories, like medicine in the 1800s

- Research 
  - Individuals will also likely do a fair amount of research to see what books they want, and the relative price of books they own or intend to buy

- Completionists
 - Depending on the person/collection some will choose some sort of "completionism" as their goal
   - For example, ALL the works of Charles Dickens in Hard cover
   - This can be damn-near impossible if your criteria is too broad

#### Rare Book Sellers
- These are usually small shops or individuals who seek valuable books to sell
- Immense research is needed to find books that can be bought and sold to make a profit

#### Associations
- The Fine Press Book Association
- The Private Libraries Association

#### Care
- As you might imagine, there are a lot of "best practices" when it comes to care of books
- Things to avoid
  - Direct exposure to sunlight
  - Dryness
    - Exposure to the wrong humidity can lead to "foxing" - spots and blotches that appear on the paper
  - Acid
    - When wrapping, do so in acid-free paper
- Dust jackets are often stored separate to avoid tearing, or other damage

### Conclusion
- Lots more here than I anticipated
- Neat
