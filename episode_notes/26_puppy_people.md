Puppy People
===

#### What is this?
* People who enjoy dressing up in dog costumes and role playing as dogs, with human 'handlers'
* Demographics:
    * Many are gay men - this is a bit of an offshoot from BDSM

#### Characters and quotes
(All of this from an article in the Guardian)
* Tom
    * Tom’s discovery of puppy play came about gradually. He knew he liked sleeping in a collar, had a fetish for skin-tight clothing... eventually, a man in a club walked up to him and said: “Oh right, so you’re a pup.” The realisation was not without its repercussions: it led to a breakup with his former fiancee Rachel and a move into a gay relationship with his new handler. Colin.
    >  it’s about being given licence to behave in a way that feels natural, even primal. "You’re not worrying about money, or food, or work, it’s just the chance to enjoy each other’s company on a very simple level."

* David
    * For David, a writer who works in academia, puppy play is an escape from the analytical world.
    > It’s so totally non-verbal... pre-conscious. It’s an instinctive, emotional space. But within every puppy is a person. This is part of my identity, but it’s only part. I’m also a vegetarian, play the piano; I have a parrot. I was planting tomatoes on my allotment this morning. I can go months without going into pup space.”

* Kaz
    * Kaz, another pup, argues that for some, being a puppy isn’t just a fun mask to try on – it’s how they identify; it’s who they are. 
    > Even when I worked in PC World I would sometimes walk up to people and nip at their shirt
    * He will socialise as a pack, enjoy physical closeness with other pups and always eats out of a dog bowl at home. “It’s just nice, it makes me feel comfortable,” he explains, before adding “But I always eat with a knife and fork and at a table. Otherwise it’s time-consuming and you can’t watch TV.”

* David
    > You are trying to grasp the positive elements of the archetype of the dog; the loyal companion
    > Some pups are solo, of course, but for me the puppy identity is focused on the bond between me and Sidney, my handler. I’ve been collared to him for 10 years. If anyone comes near him I growl like a little bull terrier.

#### What's it like?
* Similar to BDSM
    * "Top" and "Bottom"
        * Bottom sets the ground rules and Top follows
        * Bottom generally has stuff dones to them
    * Generally refer to the activity as "play"
        * This is a role playing thing, so compartmentalization
        * However, there are also long term relationships
            * This involves really good communication and compromise, obviously
        * Also, professtional people who can "play"
    * Parties, where people get together to "play"
* Subspace
    * Altered state of mind, like a hypnotic trance 
    * This is like flow, and similar to being drunk or high
* The drop, or sub-drop
    * After the session ends, as you come back to your senses and experience exhaustion and lowering in temperatures
* With puppies:
    * Sometimes sex is involved, but not _always_
    * Pupspace
        * Similar to subspace
        * It's all about letting go, not thinking, changing your headspace to pupspace
