    * Linden Lab reports that the Second Life economy generated US$3,596,674 in economic activity during the month of September 2005,[37] and in September 2006 Second Life was reported to have a GDP of $64 million.[38] In 2009, the total size of the Second Lifeeconomy grew 65% to US$567 million, about 25% of the entire U.S. virtual goods market. Gross resident earnings are US$55 million in 2009 – 11% growth over 2008.[39] In 2013, Linden Labs released an info graphic that showed that over 10 years $3.2 billion in transactions for virtual goods had exchanged between Second Life residents, with an average of 1.2 million daily transactions
    * L$ can be purchased using US dollars and other local currencies on the LindeX exchange provided by Linden Lab.  According to figures published by Linden Lab, about 64,000 users made a profit in Second Life in February 2009, of whom 38,524 made less than US$10, while 233 made more than US$5000

What’s being sold:
* At its height circa 2006, hundreds of thousands of dollars were changing hands daily as residents created and sold a wide variety of virtual commodities. Second Life also quickly became profitable due to the selling and renting virtual real estate.
* Land
    * Premium membership allows the Resident to own land, with the first 512 m²
    * There are four types of land regions; mainland, private region, homestead, and openspace.
    * Openspace regions may be either mainland or private, but have lower prim limits and traffic use levels than mainland regions. The owners of a private region enjoy access to some additional controls that are not available to mainland owners; for example, they have a greater ability to alter the shape of the land.
    * Residents may also choose to purchase, or rent, land from another Resident (a Resident landlord) rather than from Linden Lab.
* Online shopping for items:
    * Shopping Guides
* Jobs - some small time people make money
    * DJing
* Musicians, podcasters, and news organizations (including CNET, Reuters, NPR's The Infinite Mind, and the BBC) all established a presence within Second Life.[42]
