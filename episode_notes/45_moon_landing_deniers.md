Moon Landing Hoax Believers
===
* Thanks to Libby for this idea

#### What is this/Background
* General belief that we didn't land on the Moon

#### Top Reasons/Explanation
* Images from the Moon don't look right
  * Shadows in the images appear to be cast by more than one light source
  * American flag in one photo appears to be waving in the wind (wind??)
  * One photo has a rock in it, with a "C" written on it
    * Looks a lot like a "C"...
  * One photo shows a reflection of an image that looks like a studio light
  * Similar looking backgrounds in images taken from different locations on the surface
* Van Allen Radiation Belts
  * You have to pass through a lethal amount of radiation
* There does not appear to be any crater on the moon below the lander, but there is hella dust on
  the Moon's surface
* Increasing the moon landing footage by 2.5X shows the acting in normal looking gravity
* Photos from the Moon landing don't show any stars
  * NASA maybe left them out because making them
* Crosshairs
  * Some photos show crosshairs being covered by real world objects
    * Not possible if the crosshairs are from the camera, they should be on top.

#### The Subculture
* This idea is so prevalent that it has become a Meme
  * In the traditional sense of the word 

* Capricorn One (1977)
  * Film about NASA faking Mars landing
* 2002 - Dark Side of the Moon
  * Hoax documentary about how Kubrick was recruited to film the fake landing
* 2016 - Operation Avalanche
  * Film about CIA agents who infiltrate NASA and become involved in the Moon Landing faking
* 2014 - Interstellar
  * US Government directs the discrediting of NASA so people look for Earth-based solutions to global famine
  * Not to get too political but.... fake news anyone?

#### WHY Would the Fake it?
* NASA Funding
* Space Race
  * We were competing with China and Russia at this time
* Cold War 

#### WHY do People Still Believe it was a Hoax?
* Younger people have less connection to it
* And more distrust of gov.
* In 2001, Fox air the special "Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon"
  * This gave the conspiracy theory some credibility
* To be fair, there have been a ton of other government scandals, so it's not _that_ far-fetched
  * Watergate
  * NSA Wiretaps
  * 2016 election
  * Project MKUltra
    * Aka the "CIA mind control program" in the 1950's and 1960's
    > MKUltra used numerous methods to manipulate people's mental states and alter brain functions, including the surreptitious administration of drugs (especially LSD) and other chemicals, hypnosis, sensory deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse (including the sexual abuse of children), and other forms of torture.
* Internet has given hoaxes like this a giant audience who can/will listen

* Sidebar, statistics
> At the time of the first landings, opinion polls showed that overall less than five percent "doubted the moon voyage
> had taken place.".. In a 2004 poll, while overall numbers remained about the same, among Americans between 18 and 24 years old "27% expressed doubts that NASA went to the Moon,"

According to one survey:
> Between 6% and 20% of Americans, 25% of Britons, and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the manned landings were faked.

##### Tom's Opinion
* Long story short, you can find tons of explanation for and against the landing
* It comes down to what/who you believe
* It is actually very hard to deny or prove this for an individual like us
* The US government has done some other fucked up stuff, this is theory is pretty easy to believe for me.
* I'm actually not sure what I believe any more
