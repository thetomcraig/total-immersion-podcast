Zef Culture
===
## Notes
### Intro
* Zef is a South African counter-culture movement
* Counter Culture
  * A subculture whos values and norms behavior differ significantly from mainstream
    * Very often, they are the exact opposite
  * Importantly, as groups like this grow, they often overtake the mainstream - replacing norms

* Zef has been compared to simlar anarchic sub cultures in other parts of the world
* Zef style has been described as "modern and trashy, appropriating out-of-date, discarded cultural elements"

#### Demograhics Lesson
* Cape Colony (Cape of God Hope) is 2,409,804 inhabitants, which is 46.6% of South Africa
* 1,424,787 of these residents are black
* 395,034 are "coloured"
* 579,741 are white

#### History
* 1984
  * Apartheid :O
  * Just so we all know:
    > Apartheid was a political and social system in South Africa while it was under white minority rule. This was used in the 20th century, from 1948 to the early 1990s. The word apartheid means "apartness" in Afrikaans. Racial segregation had been used for centuries but when the new policy started in 1948 it was strict and more systematic.
  * It was officially banned in 1994, and after the current president's term ended, Nelson Mandela became the first black
    president
* 1960-70s
  * The term `zef` was created as a a derogatory term for working class whites in South Africa
    * Particularly inhabitants of trailer parks
  * This is a shortening of the word "Zephyr" referring to the Ford Zephyr car

    * The Zephyr was popular around the world between the 50's and 70's
    * In South Africa people would soup up these cars with enhanced engines, tires, wheels, etc
    * Among other places, this car was produced in South Africa before being shipped world-wide
* 2010's
  * Die Antwoord member Ninja claimed that zef represented South Africa
  * This made people mad, because it's more associated with a subculture of the white South Africans
* 2010
  * In an interview, Ninja responded to these comments saying that:
    > Racism is somewhat obsolete and a thing of the past for South Africans
  * He went on to related zef to American Hip-hip; i.e. a style of music _and_ a subculture
    > [zef means] that you literally don't care what anyone else thinks of you; like, you represent yourself in your music, in how you dress, in how you think, how you speak
* 2013
  * A blog called _Zef Kinners_ became a viral success in South Africa
    * It posted photos of people who were considered to exemplify zef
    * The author of the blog criticized members of Die Antwoord claiming they were the "safe" version of zef, and said that "zef has a dirty face"

#### Culture
* Yolandi Visser of Die Antwoord describes Zef as: 
  > It's associated with people who soup their cars up and rock gold and shit. Zef is, you're poor but you're fancy. You're poor but you're sexy, you've got style.
* The Dictionary of Afrikaans Language, or the "Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal" (Also known as the WAT) defined it thusly:
  > Something which is usually considered to be common, but nowadays has credibility
* Aside on Afrikaans:
  * Afrikaans is the langauge spoken in South Africa, Namibia, and to a lesser extent, Botswana and Zimbabwe
  * This began to diverge from Dutch (spoken by settlers at the Cape of Good Hope) during the 18th century
* Like Hip-hop, Zef is all about performance and bragadotio
  > Die Antwoord observed that journalists and critics, particularly in the United States, frequently ask if their creative output is a joke or a hoax. When asked if he was playing a character, Ninja said, "Ninja is, how can I say, like Superman is to Clark Kent. The only difference is I don't take off this fokken Superman suit.
* Other critics have likened zef to mean something like "redneck"

#### Conclusion
* Some writers think that zef is the expression of "self-parody" stemming from a general sense of "melancholia" in
  post-apartheid South Africa  
* Others think that there is a general sense of shame related to the end of apartheid and zef is one of the responses to this
* There are other musical acts who could be described as zef:
  * Jack Parow
  * Little Big
  * Tommy Cash
* Bet really, it's hard to describe what zef is, because there is no real analogy
* Fun facts:
  * Die Antwoord is Afrikaans fir "the answer"
  * Also they have created their own label - "Zef Recordz"
