#### What is this
> Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction or science fantasy that incorporates technology and 
aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery

> Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the 19th century's 
British Victorian era or American "Wild West"

> A future during which steam power has maintained mainstream usage, 

* Think of aspects of books by H. G. Wells, Jules Verne, Philip Pullman, etc

#### Background/General info

* But "modern" steampunk started in the second have of the 20th century
  * The 1985 Film _Brazil_ was important in establishing this genre's aesthetic

    * This inspired the 1999 Film _Wild Wild West_
      * Yes, Will Smith did have a hit single on the soundtrack to promote this film, and it's a banger
  * 1960's - _Steampunk_ term is created, as a reference to the _cyberpunk_ genre
  * 1960's - 1990's - Lots of books written in this genre all over Europe and America
  * 1995 - Term first used in a series of novels: _Steampunk Trilogy_
    > which... imagine the replacement of Queen Victoria by a human/newt clone, an invasion of Massachusetts by Lovecraftian monsters, and a love affair between Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson.
