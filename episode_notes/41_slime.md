#### Background/General info
* Goo of various types has been around forever
* 1990s - Nickeloden Slime
  > Green slime made its debut on You Can’t Do That on Television, a Canadian sketch show that aired from 1979-1990. Roger Price, the show’s creator, slimed kids for saying, “I don’t know,” simply because he found it annoying. Eventually, cast members were awarded bonus payments of $25 or $50 extra dollars for getting doused in the green stuff, after they complained of getting drenched too often. Nickelodeon recognized the crazy popularity of the You Can’t Do That On Television slime fests, and it integrated the idea into the 1986 trivia game show Double Dare.
