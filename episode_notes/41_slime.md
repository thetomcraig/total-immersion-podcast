#### Thanks to `Sam` for this idea

#### What is this
* People on Instagram sharing videos of colorful goo
* Stretching. poking, and prodding the good with their fingers making weird sounds
> "I can't decide whether this sound is me wanting to kill myself or being my only reason to live," 
 -- Instagram

#### Background/General info
* Goo of various types has been around forever
* 1980s - Ghostbusters originated this term it is believed
  * Toys labeled "slime" or "ectoplasm" spun off from that
* 1997 - Flubber
* 1990s - Nickelodeon Slime
  > The iconic green slime of the Canadian television series You Can't Do That on Television was developed by accident, according to producer Roger Price - the original idea had been to dump a barrel of food leftovers on a young boy chained in a dungeon, but before it could be used, the contents of the barrel had turned green with mold.   
  `Pause for Laughs`  
  > The noxious mixture was dumped on the young boy anyway, and overnight the series had its trademark gag.

  > [Price], slimed kids for saying, “I don’t know,” simply because he found it annoying.  Eventually, cast members were awarded bonus payments of $25 or $50 extra dollars for getting doused in the green stuff, after they complained of getting drenched too often. Nickelodeon recognized the crazy popularity of the You Can’t Do That On Television slime fests, and it integrated the idea into the 1986 trivia game show Double Dare.

  * From the Wikipedia page on this, a.k.a. `Gunge`
    > In most countries, being gunged is seen as a forfeit with the aim to cause embarrassment. In contrast, being slimed in the U.S. can be a good thing as well as a bad thing. Overall the main point of being gunged or slimed is to cause mess.
    > In many cases, the gunging occurs in a gunge tank, a transparent booth with a means for storing and releasing the gunge.

* Today
  > largely to the popularity of Nickelodeon shows, slime and gunge have typically been associated with children's programming in North America since the 1980s. In addition to its use on television and as a fundraiser, gunge in tanks sometimes features in nightclubs. Youth groups such as church groups and scouting movements also make use of gunge to "gunge the leaders" as well as the children.

    > That’s the case for another savvy slime entrepreneur, 15-year-old Alyssa Jagan from Toronto, who spends 20 hours a week whipping up slime with brightly colorful pigments and managing her account CraftySlimeCreator.  

    > For Jagan, it started as a hobby until her mother told her she had to quit because there was just “too much slime.” So she had a thought: sell it for $7 a tub. Jagan has made $6,846 selling slime since August.

#### Why do people like it?
* Its basically ASMR
* But this has an audio and visual component
* There is something very enchanting about the vidoes:
  > Prim Pattanaporn, a 23-year-old Vancouver college graduate who displays “vanilla whipped slime” on her account SparklyGoo, started making the substance in February 2016 after finding her goopy muse on Instagram. “The more slime videos I watched, the more I felt compelled to touch it,” she told TIME.  

  > The repetitive movement eventually becomes subconscious. It keeps my hands busy and almost redirects the stress to the slime.
