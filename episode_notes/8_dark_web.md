8 - Dark Web
===
* Deep Web - Parts of the WWW not indexed by search engines
    * Used For legitimate stuff like banking and online email
* Darknet - Overlay network that need special software or configurations to use
* Dark Web - Parts of the WWW that exist on darknets

    * This was a Texan guy named Ross Ulbricht
    * In 2015 he was charged with money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic fraudulent identity documents, and conspiracy to traffic narcotics
* Accessing ‚ÄúTor hidden services‚Äù with .onion domain

There are a bunch of reddits related to this, but they‚Äôre mostly lists and reviews of sites on the Dark Web
I decided to just hop on

I‚Äôm using ‚Äútor browser‚Äù which is the only way to access websites with a ‚Äú.onion‚Äù domain
The browser itself shows you how your connection is being bounced around, like a VPN
Which I also used, to be extra safe
Also my laptop is inside a condom

    * I think it‚Äôs interesting to see how people act when security and anonymity are 100% guaranteed
    * Kind of like the internet as a whole, but more extreme because few rules
    * Is this something that should exist?  Maybe it could be annihilated somehow?
        * Personally I think something like this will always exist, its just human nature
            * We create rules, but there will always be times you want to break them and not be judged, or are being barred something you want
            *
