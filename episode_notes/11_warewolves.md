11 - Warewolves
===
This is basically werewolves
====
    * Includes other like coyotes, cats, dogs, etc
    * Transformation into frogs, and even bees, has been reported in some instances. In Japan, transformation into foxes and dogs was usual
* Let's get this out of the way at the beginning: warewolves aren't real.

Reported cases:
====
* 1589, Germany Peter Stump
    * confessed to having practiced black magic since he was twelve years old. He claimed that the Devil had given him a magical belt or girdle, which enabled him to metamorphose into "the likeness of a greedy, devouring wolf, strong and mighty, with eyes great and large, which in the night sparkled like fire, a mouth great and wide, with most sharp and cruel teeth, a huge body, and mighty paws." Removing the belt, he said, made him transform back to his human form. No such belt was ever found after his arrest.
    * For twenty-five years, Stumpp had allegedly been an "insatiable bloodsucker" who gorged on the flesh of goats, lambs, and sheep, as well as men, women, and children. Being threatened with torture he confessed to killing and eating fourteen children, two pregnant women, whose fetuses he ripped from their wombs and "ate their hearts panting hot and raw,"[6] which he later described as "dainty morsels."[7]One of the fourteen children was his own son, whose brain he was reported to have devoured.
    * In addition to this he confessed to having had intercourse with a succubus sent to him by the Devil.
    * Execution: The execution of Stumpp, on October 31, 1589, and of his daughter and mistress, is one of the most brutal on record: he was put to a wheel, where "flesh was torn from his body", in ten places, with red-hot pincers, followed by his arms and legs. Then his limbs were broken with the blunt side of an axehead to prevent him from returning from the grave, before he was beheaded and his body burned on a pyre. His daughter and mistress had already been flayed and strangled and were burned along with Stumpp's body. As a warning against similar behavior, local authorities erected a pole with the torture wheel and the figure of a wolf on it, and at the very top they placed Peter Stumpp's severed head.
    * Breaking wheel - wtf
Historical examples:
King Nebuchadnezzar II
====
    *  was king of Babylon c. 605 BC â€“ c. 562 BC
* Also, it is believed that the king of Armenia Tiridates III also suffered from this disorder. He was cured by Gregory the Illuminator. As a sign of gratitude, Tiridates proclaimed Christianity as the state religion during 301, thus making Armenia the first Christian state
* According to Persian tradition, the Buyid prince Majd ad-Dawla was suffering from an illusion that he was a cow.

So some people do believe they are real.  Read a few websites about this.
