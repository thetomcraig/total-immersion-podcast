Geocaching
===
#### Thanks to `Sam` for this idea

## Notes
### Intro
* Geocaching is an outdoor recreational activity.
* You use a GPS device, or other means of navigation to hide and seek containers called "geocaches" or "caches" in
  specific locations.
* All over the world.
## Cache
* The cache itself is typically waterproof, and will often contain a log book
* The geocacher will sign the book with their name or pseudonym, and a date
* Larger containers may also contain various objects to be taken/left
  * Trinkets, keychains, etc.

#### History
* Geocaching is inspired by similar games:
  * Benchmarking, a.k.a. trigpointing
    * Participants find banchmarks, or survey markers, and log their finds
  * Orienteering
    * Group or sports that requires you to navigate from point to point at high speed
      * Using maps, compasses etc
  * Treasure-hunting
  * Letterboxing
  * Waymarking
  * Munzee

* 1854 - Letterboxing
  * Participants hide small weatherproof boxes in public areas and distribute location clues books, websites, word of
    mouth
  * Started in England in 1854
  * A guide in the area placed boxes around the moor.  Passersby would drop letters in and eventually they would be
    collected and mailed
  * They were hard to find and only the most advanced hikers could find them
    * Meaning it would often take a long time to actually mail any given letter
  * Lots of traditions surrounding the types of boxes and how they're found
* 1970s
  *  Letterboxes started to be setup in more easily accessible locations
  * Thus, the tradition of actually dropping letters in has ceased 
* 1998
  * Smithsonian Magazine had a feature on letterboxing, and the US became interested, dovetails with the inception of
    geocaching a few years later
* 2000 - Geogaching
  * The Global Positioning System, GPS, removed a feature called "Selective Availability", which made the system a lot
    more accurate
      * Selective Availability - Feature that adds intentional errors
        * This was intended to deny an enemy the use of civilian GPS receiver for precisions weapon guidance
  * First cache placed in Oregon; location posted on a Usenet newsgroup
    * According to the post it was "a black plastic bucket that was partially buried and contained software,
      videos, books, money, a can of beans, and a slingshot."
    * Eventually the cache and its contents were destroyed by a lawn mower
* 2000s
  * Varous hide and seek type activities have been attached to and removed from the hobby
  * There was some controversy over how some groups were trying to commercialize geocaching
  * Eventually an official urban game - "GeoCaching" (compared to lower case "geocaching") was developed
    * Each of these caches has a code you can enter into a website to register the find
    * Games are played to find a certain number - the first individual or group to find all is the winner
* 2011 - Munzee
  * Scavenger hunting game like geocaching that uses QR codes and GPS tech to prove a find
  * Mobile phone, tablet, computer, GPS receiver
  * LOL, under common attributes on the Wikipedia page, it lists "venue" as "Earth"

#### More Detail
* There are types of caches other than the physical containers:
  * BIT cache - card with a QR code, like a Munzee
* Virtual cache
  * Coordinates for a location that may have an object other than a container (like a historical land mark)
    * Here you log a find by taking a picture at the site
* Reverse cache
  * A description is given for something to find, and the finder locates an example of this object, records the
    coordinates 
* Others...
  * USB cache, earthcache, multicache, night cache, chirp cache, moving cache, event cache, guest book cache

#### Culture
* It's a unique culture
  * You share this hobby with a lot of people, and interact with a lot of people, but it's all passive
  * There is almost no back and forth, just contributing your two cents to the overall discussion or log
* Can be dangerous or risky
  * Often geocaches are thought to be placing or retrieving bombs; this has lead to evacuations in the past
  * Sometimes the caches are in dangerous locations like electrical boxes
* Some people or organizations consider it littering
  * In response, some cachers will pick up trash while they perform the hunt
    * There have even been events held surrounding this practice
* There is a very strong community feeling, even if you've never met the other people finding caches you've found
  * People want to improve and make things better, generally want to leave the cache in a better state than they found
    it in
* Super creative as well - hands on and artistic

#### Legacy
* This is still going strong, and as discussed, has spawned similar activities/hobbies
* Googling led me to `geocaching.com`
  ```
  Join the world's largest trasure hunt.
  There are 6,587 geocaches around Oakland.
  ```
  * And the front page directed me to smart phone apps as well
* The geocaching subreddit has 33k subscribers!
  * Lots of discussion - people are super engaged

### Conclusion
* The accuracy of GPS is actually what the whole thing hinges on
  * There is a sweet spot - because low accuracy means a lot of hunting around and high accuracy mean none
  * The accuracy of GPS today is perfect; you can easily find a general area, but then have to root around for a little
    while to find the box
* This is also a unique activity and culture because it's always different - no two caches are alike
* It's also self organizing and self policing.  Ignore the commercialized "GeoCaching", the original geocaching has
  no "official rules" or "leaders"
