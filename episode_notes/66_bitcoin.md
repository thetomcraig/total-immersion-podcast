# Bitcoin Miners

## Intro

- Bitcoin is a [crypto]currency
- To define Bitcoin we need to define cryptocurrency
- To define cryptocurrency, we need to define blockchain
- To define blockchain, we need to define cryptography

## Cryptography
- The practice and study of techniques surrounding secure communication
- Examples
  - Secret codes used in world wars
- Today, most of this work is done with computers
  - Lots of uses and implications; online banking and retail, government documents, private correspondence, etc

## Blockchain
- Invented in 2008, by an anonymous person or persons
- A growing list of records, called "blocks"
- Think about it as a ledger; it's often referred to as an "open, distributed, ledger"
- Blocks are linked together with cryptographic methods
- There is also no going back, once a new entry is in the ledger, it cannot be removed
  - When you join a group of users of a shared blockchain, you "download" all the historical ledger entries
- Lots of complex implementation allow this to be very secure, and pretty much impossible to forge
- So everyone is "on the same page" about the legitimacy and history of the ledger

## Bitcoin
### What is it?

- So, blockchain is a _technology_, that can be used for recording anything
  - Because it's so secure, it's a great tool for recording monetary transactions
  - In fact, blockchain was invented for use with bitcoin, and has inspired other technologies/tools that are built on blockchains
- Most of the stuff we talk about in reference to blockchain is applicable to other crytocurrencies

### History

- 2008
  - Bitcoin invented by unknown person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto
- 2009
  - Bitcoin open source cod is release to the internet
  - Soon after it inspires other cryptocurrencies
- 2017
  - University of Cambridge estimates that there are 2.9-5.8 using cryptocurrency; most of them Bitcoin
- Today
  - *Lots* of different tools/companies/technologies/proposals have come up, claiming to be inspired by or built on top of blockchain-esque implementations

### How Bitcoin (and others) are Used

- Sending and Receiving
  - Bitcoin is a *decentralized* digital currency without a central bank or administrator
    - Decentralization is core to how blockchain works
    - This means you don't need to trust someone like Fidelity or Wells Fargo to tell you how much "money" you have
    - Bitcoins are sent directly between users via the peer-to-peer network
  - Importantly, unlike USD that's excepted everywhere in America, you can only use bitcoin if vendors are set up to accept it
    - This means the vendors need to have *some* technical savvy
    - Places like car dealerships or real estate brokers probably aren't going to adopt this any time soon, because one needs to overcome hurdles of understanding and trust in the system
    - BUT, some international banks have started thinking about its use, and some exchanges in the US have started trading bitcoin futures
  - Most transactions take place on the "cryptocurrency exchange"
  - Some services will let you trade bitcoin for cash, but they'll take a cut (and you'll likely get taxed, too)
- Mining
  - New bitcoins are created through a process called "mining"
  - This process is essentially guessing random numbers until one is found that can meet certain mathematical requirements based on cryptographic formulas
  - So, mining means setting up a computer program to guess random numbers until a solution number is found, then do that over and over and over
    - So lots of people have person machines running these processes 24/7
- Wallets
  - A "wallet" is a computer program that holds personal credentials you use to make transactions
  - There are also physical wallets, which are, most of the time, small electronic devices that interface with your computer.
    - You'd use a physical wallet for MORE security

- Other cryptocurrencies include:
  - Ethereum
  - Ripple
  - Litecoin
  - Zcash
  - Dash
  - Monero
  - Bitcoin Cash
  - NEO
  - Cardano
  - EOS

### Greater Social Implications

- Because of this focus on decentralization, lots of ideas are shared with free market theory, and de-monopolization of banks
- Anarchists are also big fans
- Also Far Right extremist movements
- Many criticize bitcoin adherents, citing unrealistic paranoia of government takeover
- In the YouTube video _The Declaration of Bitcoin's Independence_, proponents say:
  - "Bitcoin is inherently anti-establishment, anti-system, and anti-state. Bitcoin undermines governments and disrupts institutions because bitcoin is fundamentally humanitarian"

- Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions and the high energy consumption of mining new bitcoins
  - It's not really anonymous though.  It's pseudonymous; linked to your network address

- What else do people talk about in the culture?
  - Taxes and fees and how to save the most money
  - Best applications/clients to use
