Doomsday Preppers
===
> It wasn’t raining when Noah built the ark.

#### What's this all about
- Getting ready for impending disaster
- Preparing mentally, physically, and by accumulating neccessary supplies

#### Websites
- thehomeforsurvival.com
- prepper-resources.com
- backdoorsurvival.com
- shtfplan

#### What are we really preparing for?
- Possible scenarios
  - Power outage
  - Natural disasters: drought, flood, earthquake, fire
    - The Big One (I'm waiting for this myself)
  - EMP attack/event
  - Ecenomic collapse
  - Political collapse (caused by...)
  - TEOTWAWKI (The End of the World as We Know It)

- Catagories:
  - Just Enough
  - Ready For Almost Anything 
  - See You When the Dust Settles

#### Preparing
> You’ve caught a few minutes of Doomsday Preppers on National Geographic and thought most of the people portrayed on the show were wackos and have gone way too far.  Still in the back of your mind you still think having a couple extra cans of Beanie Weenies could be a good thing for a rainy day.
### BoB
- BoB: Bug out Bag
  - Like a go bag.  Keep it near your door so you can grab it and go
  - See also "SHTF bag"
  - SHTF - Shit hits the fan
- MRE: Meal ready to eat

### Materials lists
- Basical survival prep list:
  - Batteries
  - Duct tape
  - Flashlights
  - Radio (battery powered)
  - Knife or Razor
  - First Aid Kit
  - Plastic garbage bags
  - Can opener (manual)
  - Water (for pets too)
  - Vitamins
  - Aspirin
  - Prescription medications
  - Food – items requiring minimal water
  - Toilet Paper/Paper Towels
  - Paper products (plates, silverware, cups)
  - Blankets

### Weapons
- Pretty popular catagory
  - I suspect this is the main interest for a lot of people on these websites
> The AR15 is relatively affordable with base models starting out in the $600 range, most mid-level rifles going for $1000 (+ or – $200) and upper end custom models easily eclipsing the $3000 range.  
> We currently live in a world of airport pat-downs, forced healthcare, mandatory vaccinations, and the unauthorized surveillance of our whereabouts and our communications. If many politicians have their way, soon we may lose our right to bear arms and defend ourselves.  
- Seems like a link with right wing ideology...  

### Non-material
- For long term, you basically need to be a farmer
  > Knowing how to grow your own food, how to hunt, how to split wood, how to fix a car, stitch a wound, and the list goes on and on.
- Health/fitness
  >  Over 2/3 of the USA is considered overweight.  That’s shameful at best. 
  > It’s not just about being physically strong and being able to run 5 miles, it’s also about not being dependent on medication or machines

#### Unexpected things (I didn't think about)
- When SHTF good to have precious metals (paper money is a pack of lies)

#### Are you, Rylan, prepared?
- Do you have a "go bag" or anything like that?
- What do you grab if your house is about to catch fire?

#### Conclusions
- EDC
  - Link between this and the EDC trend that we're both into
  - Why are we into that anyway? What's appealing about gathering the tools etc you think you'll need?
  - My theory - we're all aware of our own fallability and mortality, this is a way of feeling like we hae control...
- This makes me think about how fragile our world/society is
  - When SHFT I think it'll go downhill fast


> Do you have any good advise for hacpanadible people.
