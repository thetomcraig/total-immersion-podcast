### Intro
#### General
* People who collect and listen to vinyl records today

#### What is this?
* Phonograph Records
  * Gramophone record, vinyl record, etc
  * `Analog sounds stoage medium` with a spiral groove

  * Physical specifications
    * Originally made by casting shellac, then polyvinyl after the 1950's
    * Several diameters AND Rotational speeds, 12/10/7inch AND 8.3, 16.6, 33.3, 45, 78 rpms
    * Also several levels of fidelity and number of audio channels
    * LPs (Long Play)
      * Specific size of record - typically 10 or 12 inch, 33.3 rpms, and small grooves
      * Has become the standard for the entire record industry
      * Play time
        * Popular and successful because the size allowed for 20 minutes of play on each side of the record
        * This allowed for an entire pop album to fit on a single disc
        * Previously, a release would have several discs bound together like a book, called an "album"
          * This is where the name came from

#### History
  * Late 1800s
    * Devices for recording and playing sound were created by several inventors contemporaneously around this time
    * Edison among them
  * Early 1900s
    * After lots of back and forth and patent wars, discs became the primary sound recording medium
  * 1960s
    * Retained largest market share even when compact cassettes were being mass produced
  * 1980s
    * Superseded by the compact disc
  * 1990s - 2010s
    * Continued to be produced and used mostly by DJs
    * Listened to by niche groups of audiophiles
  * 2008 - 2018
    * In the last ten years, huge resurgence
    * In the US in 2014, 9.2 million records were sold
      * 260% increase since 2009
    * In UK, five-fold increase in the same time period 

#### Modern Day Resurgence
##### Reasons
* Millennial Interest
  * As of 2015, under 25 year olds mad up half of the vinyl purchases in the US
  * WHY?
    * Connection with a different era
      * More deliberate relationship with music
      * Opposite of the instant gratification of streaming services
    * Physicality
      * The record, record player, and artistic sleeve are physical artifacts
        * you don't get any of this with digital music
* Audiophiles
  * Some people think that the vinyl sound is somehow "better" than alternatives
  * This can be true due to several factors
    * High compression of digital file
    * Crappy headphones
    * Crappy internet connectivity
  * However this is not `always` true; see sidebar

* Sidebar - Digital vs. Analog Signals
  * There are two standards for recording sound (And other information)
    * Analog
      * From Wikipedia: `An analog signal is any continuous signal for which the time-varying feature (variable) of the signal is a representation of some other time varying quantity, i.e., analogous to another time varying signal.` 
      * For example, with an analog audio signal, as the voltage changes, so does the pressure of the sound waves
    * Digital
      * From Wikipedia: `[Digial signal is one] in which the continuous quantity is a representation of a sequence of discrete values which can only take on one of a finite number of values.`
  * Digital sound is therefore more precise...
