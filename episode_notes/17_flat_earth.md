===
The flat Earth model is an archaic conception of Earth's shape as a plane or disk.

History
====
* The idea of a spherical Earth appeared in Greek philosophy with Pythagoras(6th century BC)
* Aristotle provided evidence for the spherical shape of the Earth by 330 BC
* Through social media flat Earth theories have been increasing
* Have members around the world. SORRY, across the world
* Modern flat Earth hypotheses originated with the English writer Samuel Rowbotham
    * Rowbotham published a pamphlet Zetetic Astronomy
    * Published the book "Earth Not a Globe”
        * Proposed the Earth is a flat disc centered at the North Pole and bounded along its southern edge by a wall of ice, Antarctica.
        * Also published a leaflet titled "The inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scriptures”
            * Aargued that the "Bible, alongside our senses, supported the idea that the earth was flat and immovable and this essential truth should not be set aside for a system based solely on human conjecture”
    * A flat Earth journal "Earth: a Monthly Magazine of Sense and Science", was published between 1901–1904

A California man is pushing a scientific argument that you probably haven’t heard in a while: the Earth is flat.
Mike Hughes told the Associated Press that he thinks that people mistakenly believe the Earth is round because of a conspiracy among astronauts. He plans to prove that we in fact live on a flat disc by launching himself into space and snapping a photo.
The 61-year-old has spent the past few years—and $20,000—building his own rocket to make the journey. For the record: As a limo driver, he has no formal training in space launches.
“I don’t believe in science,” said Hughes, whose main sponsor for the rocket is Research Flat Earth, a group that promotes the idea that we aren’t all living on a spinning ball. “I know about aerodynamics and fluid dynamics and how things move through the air, about the certain size of rocket nozzles, and thrust. But that’s not science, that’s just a formula. There’s no difference between science and science fiction.”
On Saturday, he plans to blast off over Amboy, Calif. at speeds of up to 500 mph from a mobile home that he purchased for $1,500 and converted into a launcher.
After this weekend’s rocket ride, Hughes says he has plans for another big adventure (if he survives): He wants to run for California governor.

Model
====
* Disc, with the North Pole at its center and a 150-foot high wall of ice, Antarctica, at the outer edge.
* The Sun and Moon are each 32 miles (52 km) in diameter.
    * Sun: 864,575.9 moon: 2,159

Societies
====
* International Flat Earth Society (1950’s - 2000)
    * Published "Flat Earth News", a quarterly, four-page tabloid
    * Petered out as science proved the explanations incorrect and a fire destroyed the contact information of the members, then the dude in charge died
* Relaunch of the Flat Earth Society in 2004
    * Based on web forum
    * First official member: Thomas Dolby
        * She blinded me with science
        * Album called “The flat earth” and one called "A Map of the Floating City”
    * This split into two separate groups
* Flat earth girls
    * Globe heads - LOL

The first-ever 2017 Flat Earth International Conference (FEIC) was held in Raleigh on Nov. 9 and 10
Among the speakers were Darryle Marble

Mark Sargent, who believes all life is enclosed in a "Truman Show"-like dome structure

The conference featured talks such as "NASA and Other Space Lies," "Flat Earth with the Scientific Method," "Waking Up to Mainstream Science Lies" and "Testing the Globe.”

The next annual Flat Earth International Conference will be held in Denver, from Nov. 15 -16, in 2018. Davidson said he expects up to 1,500 attendees.
