        *  5th-century BCE
    * Indonesia[edit] and India - been common forever
    * Japan - Yakuza
        * Samurai were forced to burn their armor, so they adopted tattoo as a means of replacing the armor.  
        * Forced into hiding, they formed the fraternal order of the Yakuza.
        * City-states still paid their tributes to the local Samurai ignoring the emperor, but this was abolished by the Meji government who banned the art of tattooing.
        * This created a subculture of criminals and outcasts who ad no place in "decent society”.
        * This forced many of them into criminal activities which ultimately formed the roots for the modern Japanese mafia, the Yakuza, with which tattoos have become almost synonymous in Japan.
* Pre 1960s
    * The first documented professional tattooer in the United States was Martin Hildebrandt, a German immigrant who arrived in Boston, Massachusetts in 1846.
    * Between 1861 and 1865, he tattooed soldiers on both sides in the American Civil War. 
    * Women
        * The earliest appearance of tattoos on women during this period were in the circus in the late 19th century. These "Tattooed Ladies" were covered — with the exception of their faces, hands, necks, and other readily visible areas — with various images inked into their skin. In order to lure the crowd, the earliest ladies, like Betty Broadbent and Nora Hildebrandt told tales of captivity; they usually claimed to have been taken hostage by Native Americans that tattooed them as a form of torture. However, by the late 1920s the sideshow industry was slowing and by the late 1990s the last tattooed lady was out of business

* So anyone and everyone is getting tattoos, but there isn’t really a culture of people who get tattoos together all the time, because you have limited space on your body
* On the other hand, some people get more and more over a long period of time and build a relationship with their artists, who they see often
* Some people travel from other countries to see a particular artist
* Some people get the together to commemorate something
