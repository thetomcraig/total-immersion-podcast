BARTENDING
====
1. Who?
    1. Bartenders, obviously.  And people are drunk and stupid, duh.
2. Differences in bars from America, Australia, to England, etc.
    1. America is mostly about hospitality and “customer is right”
    2. Harder to boot people out if they are just being assholes.
    3. Differences in pay; working for tips or not.
3. Protection for Waiters and Bartenders
    1. Don’t have to pay for walkouts or stolen cards
    2. Protections against getting fired for doing the right thing
    3. Interesting that there are protections at all!
4. Post about Pregnant Bartender;
    1. More tips or less?
    2. More likely to order drinks from her or not?
5. WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A BARTENDER
    1. Customer service with drunks
    2. Cramped conditions with a lot of coworkers
    3. Fixing a keg line
    4. Taking food & drink orders, can’t get them wrong.
    5. Cleaning constantly
    6. Serving enough drinks for the customers
        1. 4-6 drinks per minute, 15 seconds to pour a pint.
        2. Cleaning constantly
    7. Cleaning constantly
    8. Try to remember this;
        1. Black Russian (Vodka and Kahlua) is the easy starting point. Now to make a White Russian it’s a Black Russian with Milk. Now to make a Paralyzer it’s a White Russian with Coke. And a Brown Cow is a White Russian without Vodka.
