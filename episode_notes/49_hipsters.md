Hipsters
===
#### History
* 1940s
  * Comes from the word "hip" or "hep"
  > In the early days of jazz, musicians were using the hep variant to describe anybody who was "in the know" about an emerging culture, mostly black, which revolved around jazz.
  > The hipster adopted the lifestyle of the jazz musician, including some or all of the following: dress, slang, use of cannabis and other drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humor, self-imposed poverty, and relaxed sexual codes.
  * The word `hepster` was used by a writer in this fashion
* 1944
  * Pianist Harry Gibson mentions `hipster` in his glossary "For Characters Who Don't Dig Jive Talk"
* 1957
  * Norman Mailer's 1957 pamphlet, entitled "The White Negro"
    * Mailer describes hipsters as individuals "with a middle-class background (who) attempt to put down their whiteness and adopt what they believe is the carefree, spontaneous, cool lifestyle of Negro hipsters: their manner of speaking and language, their use of milder narcotics, their appreciation of jazz and the blues, and their supposed concern with the good orgasm."

* Modern Era
* 1990s
  * Modern usage began, derived from the original definition
* 2000s - 2010s
  * Term became particularly prominent 
  > While mainstream society of the 2000s (decade) had been busying itself with reality television, dance music, and locating the whereabouts of Britney Spears's underpants, an uprising was quietly and conscientiously taking place behind the scenes.
  
  > Long-forgotten styles of clothing, beer, cigarettes and music were becoming popular again. Retro was cool, the environment was precious, and old was the new 'new'. 

  > Above all, [hipsters] wanted to be recognised for being different â€” to diverge from the mainstream and carve a cultural niche all for themselves. For this new generation, style wasn't something you could buy in a department store, it became something you found in a thrift shop, or, ideally, made yourself.

* Today
  * The word `hipster` is often used pejoratively to describe overly trendy or pretentious people

#### Aspects of the Modern Hipsters
* Personality

* Self Identification
  * Members of the modern hipster subculture do not self-identify as `hipsters`

#### Criticism
* It it commonly believed that hipsters appropriate the ideas and activities of various subcultures
  * Hipsters have "defanged, skinned and consumed" all the influences of previous fringe movements like Beat, Hippie, Pink, Grunge, etc.
  * For example metrosexuality as the appropriation of gay culture

* Conformity
  * The "whole point of hipsters is that they avoid labels and being labeled. However.. [they all] and conform in their non-conformity" 
  * So, ultimately, Hipsterism seems pretty disingenuous

#### Conclusion
* This is an ever-changing and nebulous subculture
  * One of the tenets of hipsterism is disavowing sub groups, i.e. denying that one is a hipster makes them one
* Irony
  * Recalls another trend in American pop culture - _irony_
  * Doing something that doesn't align with your views to make a point that you are clearly too self-aware to be performing
    the actions honestly, i.e. you aren't ignorant

* This is a growing and influential group 
  * Nipsters
    * Young neo-Nazis n Germany who have embraced hipster culture

#### Questions
* **DO NOT ASK:** `What do you think of hipsterism`
* Do you think you're a hipster?
* What can someone do to convince you they are a hipster?
