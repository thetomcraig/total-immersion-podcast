Wicca
===
### Intro
- Witchcraft
  - Very broad term; cross-cultural.
  - In most places, it generally refers to those who use supernatural power to harm innocent people
  - A more modern definition sometimes refers to harmless practices of paganism, divination, or healing

### History
- Witchcraft has been present in many cultures throughout history
- Our modern, Western, conceptions of witches draw from Old Testament laws against witchcraft
- 1500-1800: early modern period
  - Period after the Middle Ages
  - Witchcraft was feared by the Church
  - Cultural narrative was of a constant conflict between good and evil
    - Evil associated with the devil, and devil worship
  - Eventually witch trials and witch hunts in Europe
  - This largely stopped around the age of Enlightenment
- Today
  - Witchcraft has continued to exist in some form until today
  - Recently, lots of women have been drawn to Witchcraft as it is often linked to feminism
  - 2008 survey in the US reports that there were about 600,000 neo-pagans in the US, with about half identifying as Wicca
  - 20017 - some estimates report about 3 million practicing Wiccans 

#### Modern Paganism
- Paganism is the superset
- Pagan religions worship multiple deities, rather than a single God
  - This includes pretty much all religions that are not Christian, Muslim, or Jewish
  - Accounts for about 50% of all religions
  - Witchcraft is one such religion, but it's really a collection of religions
    - African witchcraft
    - Appalachian folk magic
      > Those who practice witchcraft in the Appalachian mountains see good and evil as two distinct forces that are led by the Christian God and Devil, respectively.
    - Green witchcraft
    - Hedge witchcraft
    - Hereditary witchcraft
    - Kitchen/Cottage witchcraft
    - Pennsylvania Dutch hexcraft or "Pow-wow"
      - What Germans saw Native Americans doing in Pennsylvania 
    - Traditional witchcraft
      - Often follows science/history/arts as foundation.
      - Witches contact spirits that part of an unseen spirit world
      - Magick is practical and focuses on herbs and potions
    - Wicca
      > Wicca is one of the modern Pagan religions that worships the Earth and nature, and it is only about 60 years old. It was created in the 1940s and '50s by Gerald Gardner. Gardner defined witchcraft as a positive and life-affirming religion that includes divination, herblore, magic and psychic abilities. Wiccans take an oath to do no harm with their magick


#### Wicca
- By far the most popular type of witchcraft today
- First half of the 20th century
  - Wicca is developed in England
  - Older forms of Wicca include belief in two gods: a female Mother Goddess and a male Horned God. 
- 1940s 
  - Modern version of Wicca created by Gerald Brosseau Gardner (1884-1964), a British civil servant and Christian minister
  - Considered the "father of modern witchcraft"
    - Drew inspiration from Freemasonry, Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and others
- 1960s-70s
  - Wicca spreads out of UK and became associated with feminist movements and environmental movements
  - At this time it split into various offshhots; "Alexandrian Wicca, Algard Wicca, Georgian Wicca, Druidic Wicca, Seax-Wica, Eclectic Wicca, etc"
  - 1985
    - US government officially recognized Wicca as a religion
- Men and women can be referred to as "witches"; the term "warlock" is considered derogatory
 
##### The Culture and Activities 
- Celebrations
  - Encompass both the cycles of the Moon, and the Sun
   
- Covens
  - Groups of witches meet together in a coven
    - Covens generally have between 3 and 13 members

- Rituals
  - Rituals generally take place during the new Moon or full Moon
  - These are the traditional steps:
    - Purification of the sacred space and the participants
    - Casting the circle
    - Calling of the elemental quarters
    - Raising a cone of power
    - Drawing down the Gods
    - Spellcasting
    - Great Rite
    - Wine, cakes, chanting, dancing, games
    - Farewell to the quarters and participants
  - Often the rites include magical tools: altar, knife, wand, chalice, broomstick, candles, incense, etc
  - There is often a circle that one enters to perform the rituals
  - Sometimes rituals are performed nude
   
- Magick
  - Wiccans believe magick to be the art of causing change to occur
  - This does not mean that it is supernaturnal; rather it acts on subtle aspects of the natural world
    > Magick [sic] is another word for transformation, creation, and manifestation. Wicca magick is a tool we use to act on the subtle—or energy, or quantum—level of reality. The quantum level is the causal realm. It is the subtle influences at the quantum level that decide which way reality will go.
  - The spelling of magick with a "k" is the accepted spelling within Wicca
  - The spelling is meant to differentiate it from that magicians or illusionists do
- Spells
- "Casting a spell" can be done through various rituals; from simple to complex
  - Generally involves setting an intention, and conducting a set of steps
