  - Facebook groups, subreddits, twitter, etc

    - Subreddit discussion should be based around personal hobbies, not news articles that can be posted anywhere.
- Posts from other communities such as:

      > So aside from all this, I've been involved in the Beanie Baby group on Facebook, which is run by three actual experts in the community, who have been around since the beginning and know what they're talking about.

  - Rowing
  - Artisanal Adult Toys
    > So, the artisanal dildo community is pretty rife with drama just in general – it’s an interest group that borders a lot of sensitive topics such as gender, sexuality, and the whole complicated subject of sex itself.
