    * To promote the EP, they sent out a pink van with flowers on it.  However, this promotional tactic proved to be incomprehensible to many people, who did not understand what the van was promoting, and onlookers yelled homophobic insults at the drivers.

Mythos
====
* The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the Dark Carnival, a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities.
* The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the "evil ways" of listeners before "the end consumes us all”.
* Incredible amount of detail on the cards (characters) and the story of the carnival
