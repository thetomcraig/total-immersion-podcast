Dressage
===
### Intro
- According to Wikipedia dressage is:
> a highly skilled form of riding performed in exhibition and competition, as well as an "art" sometimes pursued solely for the sake of mastery.
- French term, most commonly translated to "training"
- This is an equestrian sport, as defined by the International Equestrian Federation
  - The IEF claims dressage is the "highest expression of horse training"
- Fundamental purpose of dressage is:
  - "to develop, through standardized progressive training methods, a horse's natural athletic ability and willingness to perform, thereby maximizing its potential as a riding horse." -- Wikipedia

### History
- Classical Dressage
  - The dressage and Equestrian pursuits we see today grew out of more "classical dressage"
  - Classical dressage, in turn, evolved from cavalry movements for use on the battlefield
  - One of the stated goals of classical dressage (and modern dressage) is to have the horse perform with "the degree of athleticism and grace that it naturally shows when free"

- 350 BC
  - Yes, people were alive at this time!
  - Athenian historian and soldier Xenophon (430 - 354 BC) writes two treatises on horsemanship (equestrianism)
    - Called "On Horsemanship" and "The cavalry commander"
  - On Horsemanship
    - Deals with the selection, care, and training of horses
      - Chapters:
        - Selecting a Young Horse
          - This section suggested getting a horse that had attributes among the following:
            - Thick cannon bones
            - Good bend in the knees, as the horse is less likely to stumble or to break down
            - Thick and muscular forearms
            - Large nostrils, for good respiration and a fiercer appearance
            - Double "loins" are more comfortable to sit on, as well as prettier
            - A deep, rounded side, which allows the rider to stay on more easily, and allows the horse to better digest his food
            - The hindquarters should be muscular and firm, for speed
            - He should not have large testicles
        - Breaking the Colt
        - Selecting an Older Horse
        - Caring for the Horse
        - Grooming the Horse
        - Grooming and Bridling the Horse Correctly and Safely
        - Mounting, Rider's Position, and Training
        - Advanced Training
        - Riding the Spirited and Dull Horse
        - Creating a Showy Horse and Advice on Bitting
        - Creating a Parade Horse
        - The Equipment for Battle
- 15th Century
  - Brute force training of horses fell out of favor
  - The start of artistry in riding
- 1515
  - The treatise "The Rules of Riding" was published; the first one since Xenophon's
  - What would be considered "modern dressage" has evolved from equestrianism at this time
- Victorian era
  - By this time, "indoor riding" had become an art form, requiring years of training

### Culture
- Training
  - This involves a LOT of training
  - Classical dressage has a lot of very specific and involved movements, for example:
    - piaffe, passage, half-pass, extended trot, pirouette, and tempi changes.
    - courbette, capriole, levade, and ballotade.

- Competitions
  - Much of this culture centers on performance in a competition
  - There are various levels
  - Arena
    - Two sizes, lager one is 20x60m (66x197ft)
    - Several cones placed in the arena with letters on them
      - These are used to specify where moves are to take place
  - Judging
    - A competition at each level will consist of multiple "tests"
      - Series of movements ridden in an arena
    - Judges placed at points around the circumference of the arena to view the horse and rider at all angles and catch any small errors
    - Judges will evaluate each movement based on the appropriate standard, and score each one, 0-10
      - 0 - "not executed", 10 - "excellent"
      - A score of 6 or higher will allow a contestant to advance to the next round
    - The rules for competitions are made by the organizations, which may vary based on the level of the competition
      - For example, in the US we have the Equestrian Foundation and the United States Dressage Federation
    - Also, more general things can be graded on, like the horse's gait, submission, etc.  Also the performance of the rider
  - Dress
    - There is also an incredible amount of regulation around what the horses and humans can wear
    - This is due to formality/tradition as well as an attempt to curb unfair advantages

- Breeding
  - Many of the horses ridden in these competitions are horses bred specifically for dressage
- Lots of competitions are held for dressage
  - Olympic games
  - the "World Equestrian Games"

### Criticism
- There is some debate between those who are trained in classical dressage vs those who are trained in more modern dressage
  - It's all related to how the training and movements are played out and what's considered "correct"

- As you might expect there have been tons of allegations of animal cruelty
  - Videos and allegations of riders harming horses to "train" them
