Polyamory
===

#### What's this all about
* Practice of or desire for intimate relationships with more than one partner
* Also defined as: "consenual, ethical, and responsible non-monogamy"

* Varied rules/themes and different views towards love, intimacy, honesty, integrity, equality, communication, commitment

* Swingers
  * This is not the same as swingers or casual sex with mutliple people
  * More of an emotional commitmenr

#### Religion
  * Some people identify as Christian and Polyamrous, but mainly this is frowned upon by Christian communities
  * Recently:
    * On August 29, 2017, the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the "Nashville Statement".
    * Among other things, it states, "We deny that God has designed marriage to be a homosexual, polygamous, or polyamorous relationship."
    * Generally speaking, most religions are against this, except Unitarianism
      * Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness, founded in 2001, has engaged in ongoing education and advocacy for greater understanding and acceptance of polyamory within the Unitarian Universalist Association.

#### Mirriage
  * Many countires follow monogamous norms
  * Bigamy - Marrying one person while being married to another  
  * In most countires, legally it's okay to have sexual/romatic relationships with multiple partners


#### The Practice
  * Fidelity/loyalty
    * In monogamous relationships this is sexual exclusivity
    * For polygamous relationships; it's faithfullness to the promeisses/agreements made at the beginning of the relationship
  * Communication/Negotiation
    * Explicit negotiation is important, because there is no societal norm or "model" for these relationship
    * Allows for a fair amount of forgiveness/leeway
    * "Don't ask don't tell" is not the best model

#### Reddit
  * Lots of pride about this lifestyle
  * Cross over of communities; LGBTM 
    * Some people attracted to their male and female relationship partners
  * Lots of posts with large beds that can fit 3 people
    * Three seems to be the most common number of individuals in a relationship
    * Very supportive and positive community online 
  * Transitions are difficult
    * Married heterosecual couples in which one partner decides they're gay
  * Successful polyamorous marriages
  
#### Conclusion
  * A lot of communication and work goes into these relationships
  * So people obviously must do this because they couldn't imagine living any other way
  * Could you ever do it?


* "Fluid Bonding" - Uhhh
