        - People are interested for various reasons
          - Wanting to know more about the two boys who commited the crimes
          - Relating to their feelings and writings

        - When is something for real vs. "internet talk"?
      - How to tell what people's intentions are
        - Some people just interested in criminology
          - People get interested in the headspace; how are the people feeling?
            - What drives someone to kill?
            - Are these feeling relatable?
        - Some saying they want to copy the shooters
    - Lots of cross-over between these people and neo-nazis
      - This has become very prevalent in these circles; basically a "fad"

  - Boston Marathon Bombing
    - Ocurred April 15, 2013
    - Quick Summary:
      - On April 16, A Redditor made a subreddit to consolidate information about the event
      - By April 17, over 3k members
      - On April 18, FBI published photos of suspects
      - After this, one redditor suggested similarity between one photo and 22 year old American student Sunil Tripathi, who had gone missing before the bombings
      - This post had no evidence (violating the sub's rules) but was not removed; swamped with posts
      - Then a woman tweeted claiming to be his classmate and suggested the similarity as well
      - Then people began trying to contact Tripathi's family
      - Then the bombing suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev killed a police officer of the MIT PD
      - Following day a redditor tweeted:
        ```
        BPD has identified the names: Suspect 1: Mike Mulugeta. Suspect 2: Sunil Tripathi.
        ```
      - Then a Buzzfeed reporter shared a tweet that named Tripathi as the primary suspect
      - April 23 Sunil Tripathi was found dead in the Seekonk River in RI
      - Turns out he committed suicide, but before the bombings even took place

  - Many violent tv shows
