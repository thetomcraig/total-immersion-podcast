### Intro
- Typewriters
  > A typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for writing characters similar to those produced by printer's movable type

### History

- 1874
  - First commercial typewriters are made available
- mid-1880s
  - Typewriters become common in offices
- mid-1980s
  - Typewriters continue to be the standard until this time

- 20th century
- Input devices similar to the typewriter are used, and developed with computers
- Computer keyboards use input similar to typewriters (qwerty)
 
- 1984
  - Introduction of the mouse as an input device for computers
  - Keyboard was primary input device until this time
  - Early keyboards were "mechanical"
    - We'll get back to this; it basically means they were large and chunky and loud
 
- 1990s - 2000s
  - Rubber dome supercedes mechanical style because it's cheaper
    - More on this also in next section
    
- 2000s - today
  - Ability to manufacture smaller keyboards because easier and more cost-effective
  - Drawing form inspiration of laptop keyboard technology, "chiclet" style keyboards slowly becoming the standard
    - This is the style that Macbooks have, and modern external Apple keyboards
     
### Mechanical keyboards
- This style uses an individual "key switch" beneath each keyboard key, that's independently mounted to the circuit board 
  - This is in opposition to rubber dome, which uses small rubber domes beneath the keyboard keys
    - The rubber dome sits above two sheets of plastic with the electronic circuit printed onto them
    - The key "bounces back" due to the reflexive pressure from the rubber dome
- Mechanical keyboards are still manufactured, even though the technology is older and more expensive than more recent styles
  - WHY?? Hobbyists

- Hobbyists
  - The key switch is a small box with a spring inside
  - Mostly fueled by hobbyists, there are new/old companies that still manufacture these switches - you can even buy them separately from the keyboard
  - Hobbyists like to be able choose key switches that have their preferred feel
    - Lots of variety exists in the acuation force and the sound and feel of the switches
  - There is also a huge variety in:
    - The "layout" - split/ergonomic, different keys in different positions
    - Key caps - the plastic part that sits on top of the key switch.  Lots of colors etc
 
- Manufacturing 
  - There is enough interest in these types of keyboards, that brand new manufacturers have sprung until existence in the last ~10 years
  - These are typically small companies that manufacture keyboards and sell them to the small but passionate fan base who are willing to pay a premium 
  - The companies can also specialize, sometimes only manufacturing switches, or key caps
  - These manufacturers often have constant contact with their fan base
    - Posting on Instagram about upcoming products for example
    - Opening up polls, that fans can fill out to vote on what the company should manufacture next
    - Often this means the products are made in very small batches
  - One prominent example is the company _Drop_ (formerly - _Massdrop_) 
    - This company was founded in 2012, specifically for small batch production and selling of products like apparel, audio gear, etc
 
 - DIY
  - There is a crossover with a lot of people in this community, and those who like DIY projects
  - Many people make their own keyboards
    - Either from scratch, or by buying the circuit board, switches, caps, case, from a third party and assembling everything 
  - Also crossover with programmers - there are open source programming languages that you can use to change the behavior of the keyboard's output
    - For example, inserting a key combination when you press a different key

- Secondary market
  - Due to the small batch size of many products, there is a very active secondary market for these keyboards
  - Buying and selling new and used products
  - Often selling keyboards that people have built themselves
### Conclusion
- This is cool.  I'm into it so obviously _I_ like it
