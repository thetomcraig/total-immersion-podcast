### Intro

    * This state is referred to as "inceldom."
* Most incels are straight white males

  * resentment
  * misanthropy
  * self-pity
  * self-loathing
  * misogyny
  * racism
  * entitlement to sex
  * and endorsement of violence against those who are sexually active

### History
* 1993
  * Canadian college student, Alana, started a website called "Anala's Involuntary Celibacy Project"
    * She shared stories of her sexual experiences, and other started to contribute
* 1997
  * Alana started a mailing list, titled with the abbreviation "INVCEL", which later became "INCEL"
    * Therein , she described an incel as "anybody of any gender who was lonely, had never had sex or who hadn't had a relationship in a long time"
    * Eventually she gave the website away to a stranger
  * 2018
    * In an interview Alana said, "It definitely wasn't a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems. That's a pretty sad version of this phenomenon that's happening today. Things have changed in the last 20 years
* 2003
  * Message board love-shy.com was founded
  * Discussion forum for people who were perpetually rejected or extremely shy
* Recent time
  * Drawing inspiration from these sources, subreddit `r/incels` was created
    * Very toxic place, members constantly posted sexist and racist things, and advocated for rape
* 2017
  * After a petition on Change.org, `r/incels` was banned by reddit for violence against women
  * At this time, the subreddit had around 40k subscribesr

### Culture
* Subreddit
  * Some posts include:
    * "Reasons why women are the embodiment of evil"
    * "Proof that girls are nothing but trash that use men"
  * This seems very similar to gamer culture; lots of immature men saying terrible things
  * Incel members constantly complain/hate on both:
    * Normies
    * Chads
      * Wears bright neon, $3000 boots, hair firmly plastered into place, does not register emotions of others, alpha
    * Stacys
      * Big tits, long hair, $2000 purse, lots of makeup, fucks Chad
    * Beckys
      * $5 backpack, works at Starbucks, thinks guys like the "natural" look, baggy clothes
  * Members also idolize people like Elliot Rodger, who perpetrated the 20134 Isla Vista Killings

* Men's Rights
  * Backlash movement against feminism 
  * Generally considered to be to be a hateful and violent movement

* Red Pill
* Some in the Men's Rights movement use the red/blue pill terms to mean:
  * This is a reference to the blue/red pill from the Matrix movie
  * Taking the blue pill - conventional dating practices.  "What women _say_ the want."
  * Taking the red pill - what women _really_ want - which is old-fashioned gender roles
    * Women might say they want equality etc, but they've been brainwashed
  * Author Donna Zuckerberg states "Red Pill represents a new phase in online misogyny. Its members not only mock and belittle women; they also believe that in our society, men are oppressed by women."

* Black Pill
  * Set of beliefs held by members of incel communities
  * May include set of beliefs such as:
    * Biological determinism
    * Fatalism
    * Defeatism
  * Someone who believes the black pull set of theories is "blackpilled"
  * Taking the black pill means accepting that everything is hopeless

* Misc.
  * Other related movements exist 
    * Mens' Rights
    * Fathers' Rights
    * Men Going Their Own Way
    * antifeminism
    * Pick-up artistry
    * Alt-right
  * Also other websites exist
    * SlutHate
    * Return of Kings

### Conclusion
* This blows, and it feeds on itself
