3 - Hats/HAM Radio
===
r/HamRadio
====

1. Set up help, what to buy and consider
    1. Radios
    2. Antena
    3. Power
    4. Mods
    5. What License do you have?
    6. Mobile, Portable, or Base?
2. Why do people still use Ham Radios?
    1. Hiking and travelling - hearing to local info and community
    2. Research - organized by semi-pro groups about responsiveness of the radio signals.
        1. Countrywide group learning about the effects of the Eclipse on radio signal and strength/clarity.
    3. Emergency communication - in disasters, extreme situations, other communication outages.
        1. GRANDPA STORY (see below)
    4. Electronics Enthusiasm - hacking the chips and circuitry to enable more frequencies and capabilities; Police Scanners etc.
        1. All used for good intentions (I assume)

3. GRANDPA STORY:
    1. During a big fire (usually in the mountains) the Fire Dept and Police Dept, and Forest Rangers and CHP could not communicate with each other on radios (and no cell phones back then).  so they would stations a CB radio guy at a command center, and then other CB radio guys, like Grandpa, would go out in their trucks and park at strategic locations so they could communicate with whichever agency they were parked near, and relay information back to the command center, or to other guys.  (It reminds me of the scene in LOTR when they lit one fire after another on the mountain top to transmit their message!)
    2. IT took a bunch of CB radio guys to do this - there was a club that they all belonged to and it was coordinated by the club members as to who would go to which relay point.

r/Hats
====
1. Subtitle: “Hatters gonna hat”
2. Who are the redditors?
    1. Hard to tell honestly, the reddit only has 1324 subscribers, which is not many.
    2. Mostly young men looking for buying advice
1. What types of hats are there?
    1. Almost entirely baseball-style hats:
        1. Did learn about  “Dad hats” - apparently this is what’s new in the fashion world.
        2. Curved brim - fits your head really well, adjustable strap.
        3. Like with brands, at any given time a style of hat can be the “big thing”
            * Fitted -> snap back -> curved brim snap back -> dad hat
2. Like with clothes - a few people are hard core.
    1. Watched a video of a guy comparing hats and I couldn’t even tell the difference.
3. But most posts are requests for identification from pics, or links to buying/discussing products for sale.
4. Some posts which are just pictures of weird hats people have lying around, or them wearing a new hat.
5. Couple cool DIY projects, but these are the exception.
6. Confirmed - lots of fedora posts.
    1. People are definitely against the fedora + t shirt and jeans combo; I appreciate.
    2. “It's a nice hat, but please, for the love of God, do not wear it with a t-shirt and jeans.”
    3. EXACTLY MY SENTIMENT ^
7. King Gustaf of Sweden loves wearing silly hats, and there is an album of these pictures circulation online with no explanation
    1. Turns out they’re all photoshopped very well, and his name isn't even Gustaf, it’s Carl Gustaf.
    2. Wtf
8. Honestly I found this reddit kind of lacking, and expected it to be more lively…
    1. No historical discussion
    2. No artistry or discussion on wardrobe overall
    3. No reviews or anything of that sort
    4. Posts generally had under 5 comments
9. For comparison’s sake, r/Fashion has 117,203 subscribers and is more lively and welcoming.
    1. Discussion on the best clothes for someone with a trach tube
    2. Discussion about how Ivanka Trump’s clothing line is doing today
    3. Discussion on old fashion vs. new fashion with interesting photos
    4. Lots of DIY
10. So in conclusion r/hats was okay, but didn’t offer much over r/fashion similar fashion reddits.  Maybe potential readers are on those sites?  Not sure.
