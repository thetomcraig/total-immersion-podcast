- Radio Luxembourg broadcast out of the Grand Duchy Luxembourg and did not have a license from the UK Gov’t, they had their own licenses.
- Listeners in the UK were technically breaking the law listening to an unlicensed broadcast but wanted to listen, they didn’t like BBC “highbrow” content.
  * Didn’t matter, a bit of a legal gray area, British newspapers still posted schedules of the unauthorized Radio Luxembourg.

- In Israel, they had the “Voice of Peace” for 20 years.
  * Deliberate interference * usually on two-way radios.
- causes harm to Aviation and Nautical communications.
- can cause serious harm and is the most prosecuted.
  * Inadvertent interference * most common.
- Consists of music, talk, generally “normal” content.
- Who are the Pirates?
  * These are not the usual “pirate.”
- Mostly, they all just wanted to run their own music related radio station.
- Sometimes they covered areas where there was not a lot of other good radio content.
  * Sometimes no radio would otherwise reach these areas.
- Often, these were people from the US who would go set up shop to broadcast into the UK.
  * couldn’t find specifics, but it seems like the BBC really sucked for a long time.
- Carl McIntire, religious fundamentalist and prolific writer and minister.  Super popular.
- Community?
  * It is a very community driven thing, good and bad.
- playing music for a community.
- talks of peace or propaganda
- A station is always started with the community in mind, and the people involved want to bring something new to that community either for profit, political benefit, shits and giggles, or just want a different voice to be heard.
