* Vocab:
    * Typography: The art and technique of arranging physical or digital type.
    * Typesetting: The act of arranging physical or digital type.
    * Type: Printed or digitally reproduced glyphs.
    * Glyphs: The symbols in a typeface that represent characters like A, ! or 5.
    * Kerning, tracking, serif, sans serif
* Who are the redditors?
    * Serious/amater designers
    * People looking for resume or website advice
    * Randos
* People making their own fonts
    * Computer programs to fine tune fonts and design an entire character set.
    * I knew this existed, obviously, but they’re very complex.
* These people are insanely good at identifying fonts, (there’s a subreddit for it even)

* Relates to overall design ideas/concepts
    * Emotion and feeling behind art pieces…
    * Art and the written word can make you feel a certain way, regardless of the meaning of the actual words
    * For example: “Brutalism (architecture)”
        * In its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture.
        * In one critical appraisal by Banham, Brutalism as posited not as a style, but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness.
* Font pairing is a thing - lots of opinions on that
* Font design for others written languages like Chinese.
    * Chinese is so complex, to design a typeface requires creating ~13k individual glyphs.  This can take years and a team of designers… insane
    * Chinese also has a “serif vs sans serif” concept: “Heiti” and “Mingti”
    * Every chinese character is its own image, made up of many strokes - anywhere from 1 to 20 something… insane
* What’s the next “big thing” will be in font-land?
    * Trends in fots usage and typography, like trends in artistic styles…
* How does a typeface for a brand influence your conception?
    * Ex: switch from skeuomorphism -> minimalism on iOS:
        * This inspired other digital media designers
        * They changed the font on macOS and iOS too...
    * Ex: Channel 4 rebrand (british TV):
        * Creation of a new font for use on their promos.
            * Personally I hate it - emotions… interesting…
* Similarly, how do you choose a font taking into account usage and representation?
    * Phone screen vs. giant billboard ad, etc
    * Ex: Early pokemon games couldn’t use the complex Japanese characters because 8 bit gameboy screen didn’t have enough pixels.
* Brain understands words as pictures
    * We don’t spell out words every time we read.
    * Typography can affect this.
    * Read the abstract of this study to Rylan:
        * http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/35/12/4965.full.pdf
* Speaking of the brain - these people are creative
    * What does it mean to be a “creative” person?
    * Our society classifies people by their professions
        * Some people are “creative types”
        * But this is not binary, we’re more complex than this
    * The people on r/lettering are very creative
        * Cool that some people just feel the need to make stuff, even if it’s bad
        * Tumblr that posts an ampersand every day, lol http://ampersandampersand.tumblr.com/
        * Mention that TED talk I just watched
            * https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity
