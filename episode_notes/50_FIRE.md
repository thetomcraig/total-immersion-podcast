FIRE
===
* Thanks to Laura for this topic

### General
#### What is this?
* FIRE Financial Independence and Early Retirement
* You can start withdrawing money from an IRA at age 49.5, and Social Security starts benefits at 62.
* BUT FIRE is all about retiring in your 30s or 40s

* Quick Maffs
  * 69% of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings
  * 34% have no savings at all

#### Financial Independence
* "Financial independence ultimately means that you can shape your life without taking money into consideration"
* "Most of us have to consider our finances in nearly every decision we make, or maybe even make decisions solely based on money. But once we reach financial independence, we get the freedom not to be bossed around by what we earn or what we have saved."

#### Retirement
* FIRE does not require you to quit your job
* The term "retire" here does not mean quitting your day job per se
* But because you're financially independent, you can choose to work on not

### Why Do This?
* You should NOT pursue FIRE when you simply hate your job:
  > Retiring early because you don’t like your job is a bad reason to do it, and is a recipe for being bored or aimless when you get there,” she said. “Achieving FIRE is a big deal, and it takes a lot of focus and determination. It’s not for those who want to get rich quick, or for those who just hate their job. 
* Freedom
* Safety net
* TIME
* Capitalism/Consumerism
  * Desire to avoid 

### How do you do this?
* Basics are super simple:
  * Spend less than you earn and "save the difference in low-fee investments like index funds"

* Simple formula: your net worth is 25x your annual expenses
  * If your total net worth is $1mil, then your expenses would have to be $40k

* Saving
  * Obviously saving is crucial, and you should be scrupulous in what you can cut down on
    * "To highlight the value of cutting expenses, for every $100 per month you can trim, it means you need $30,000 less to achieve FI"
  * It's more bout being "intentional with your money" than about being frugal

#### Criticism
* Affordability
  * Critics say that this is not tenable for many, who don't have high paying jobs
    * Some FIRE pursuers refute this, claiming the critics are not saving or cutting back enough
    * Many in the community do admit this though
  * So you don't necessarily need to make six figures to achieve FIRE, but the income gap in America makes this complicated

#### Reddit
* Mix of things, as per usual
  * Actual advice
  * Jokes
    > I've been using only ~6” of floss the past week. Previously I used closer to 15”. I figure I should be able to retire a day or two earlier with the savings from using/buying less floss.
  * Guides
  * Discussion
    * People do a bunch of math a calculate their "FIRE date" - when they can stop working

#### Other Media
* Tons of books, podcasts, movies, etc
* Kickstarter documentary on people pursuing this lifestyle

#### Conclusion
* I'm of two minds on this
  * Saving is obviously smart, but people can take it too far
  * Obviously there are extremes, as with any subculture

#### Questions
* Is this possible for you?
* Do you budget?
* How much do you save?
* How could you cut down if you wanted/needed to?
