Demoscene
===

### What's this all about & History
* International computer art subculture focused on producing `demos`
* Demos
  * Self-contained, sometimes v small, computer programs that produce audio-visual presentations
  * Purpose is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills
  * Good example would be the old school iTunes music visualizer
* Demos shared at festivals - `demoparties` 
  * More on this later

* 1970's - How computer revolution started
  * Easy for anyone (with the know-how) to start messing around with a computer
  * NOTE, this is nerdy stuff; things were not super user friendly
    * Think, MSDOS, not and iPad
* 1970's - 80's
  * Software Cracking becoming a thing
  * Very new, people didn't really understand it, and it was like the Wild, Wild, West
  * Software Crackers would add little intro screens to the software they cracked called `cracktros`
    * NOT and intro to a porno, I think
  * Initially linked to video games, creating these visuals became it's own practice
  * People started to compete to make the coolest ones
* 1980's - 1990's
  * Demo parties start becoming a thing
  * More face to face meeting
  * Competitions start
  * As association with hacker scene became weaker, less focus on illegal activity and cracking
  * Illegal software practices and booze mostly banned
* 1990's - Now
  * Parties attracted more people interested in gaming and general computer stuff
    * Demosceners annoyed by this - lamers!
  * Scene.org - non-profit organization that serves as the largest demoscene file repository
    * Founded in 1996
    * As of 2013 host over 1 TB of data (bear in mind many individual demos are < 1MB)
    * Sponsored by Pixar among others
    * 2003 - 2012 they gave out awards for demos voted on by a jury
  * As of 2010 the size of the scene was estimated at about 10,000
  * Demoparties broadcast online

### Culture
* Back in the day, the relationship between software and hardware was flipped:
  * Today, there are a couple mainstream OSes (software) that run on a bunch of different machines (hardware)
  * When IBM and similar companies were big, there were a few computer models (hardware) that could run whatever software you wanted
* Because of this, everyone had the same hardware limitations when writing software
* So people would compete by trying to make the coolest thing with just programming skills
  * Similar to old school video games
    * Not a lot of colors/pixels/memory so visual tricks used to make stuff look unique
    * Apparently this is why Mario has suspenders
    * Also fun fact - Colossal Cave Adventure (ADVENT)

* Lots of similarities with "hacker" culture - HACK THE PLANET!
* This is a very competitive (and male, obviously) subculture
> Those who achieve excellence are dubbed "elite", while those who do not follow the demoscene's implicit rules are called "lamers"; 
> They emphasize creativity over "ripping" (or else licensing) the works of others, having good contacts within the scene, and showing effort rather than asking for help
* Very closed off and reclusive subculture

* Groups 
  * Most often made up of small groups of people (under 10)
  * Usually have a name, and individuals a handle
  * Group name examples:
    * Farilight
    * Conspiracy
    * Pluisje
    * Andromeda Software Development
    * The Black Lotus
    * Xerxes
    * MFX
    * Equinox
  * Group member's name examples:
    * Navis
    * Ch3
    * aMUSiC
    * Nina
    * Leviathan
    * Ars Nova
    * BoyC
    * Innocent
    * Xenophobe
    * ZooM
    * Little Bitchard
    * Tron Jeremy
    * Justin Case
    * Orlando Boom
    * Uncle Ben
    * Mel Funktion
    * sumo lounge
    * memon

#### Events
* Demoparties - similar to a hackathon
  * Usually several days, everyone in a room together conversing and working
  * Most popular in Europe - about 50 parties held a year
  * Not so much in USA - two or three a year
  * Atendees range from dozens to hundreds
  * Lot of time actually spend outside for socializing, BBQing etc
* Competitions
  * Programmers show off their demo and audience votes
  * Compos - organized competitions are held at demoparties
  * Online competitions as well
  * Nowadays the focus is on artistic quality rather than programming technique or packing the most into a small
    package
  * Categories may include:
    * Best Demo
    * Best 64K Intro
    * Best Effects
    * Best Graphics
    * Best Soundtrack
    * Best Direction
    * Most Original Concept
    * Best Demo on an Oldschool Platform

### Influence on greater culture
* Lots of game designers are or used to be demosceners
  * Designers of Max Payne games
  * Will Wright names demoscene as a major influence on the Maxis game Spore
  * Angry Birds designed by well-known demoscener
* So lot's of influence on creative fields that use computer software - dope
