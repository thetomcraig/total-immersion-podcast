QANON
===

#### Thanks to `Avi` for this idea

### What is this
It's a conspiracy theory based on `Q`, an online account used on several websites.  
_NOTE_: Seems like `Q` and `QAnon` are used interchangably, so I'll use the term `QAnon`

#### Background/General info
Presumably this is an American.  
QAnon has claimed to have access to classified information concerning the Trump Administration.  
QAnon has detailed a political conspiracy theory (we'll break it down later)

#### Where did this come from?
* 2017 (October)
  * Someone under the handle "Q Clearance Patriot" appeared on 4chan's "/pol" board.
    * Btw, "/pol"'s full title is "Politically Incorrect"
    * So you get the vibe, this is where neo-Nazis hangout
  * The user's post: "Calm Before the Storm" referenced a comment by Trump at a photo-op with senior military leaders in October, 2017:
    > TRUMP: "You guys know what this represents? ... Maybe it’s the calm before the storm."  
    > REPORTER: "What storm, Mr. President?"  
    > TRUMP: "You'll find out."  
* Later, poster moved to 8chan, reddit, Twitter, imgur
  * Cross-posting happening by other users
  * I found a _43 page_ imgur post detailing the whole theory
* Sean Hannity has tweeted about this
* Russian Government-funded _RT News_ has discussed it
* Alex Jones (Info Wars) is a proponent
  * Although later he dropped support claiming QAnon had become "compromised"
* 2018 (March)
  * Reddit banned one of the QAnon related subreddits
    * Subsequently, the community moved to Dicord
  * VP of the company "Operation Rescue" came out in support of QAnon
    * That's an anti-abortion organization
  * Rosanne Barr promoted the theory; this was covered by CNN, The Washington Post, and The NY Times
* 2018 (June)
  * An armed man in an homemade armored truck shut down a highway near the Hoover Dam and held up signs referencing QAnon.
  * Time Magazine named the anonymous "Q" as one of the 25 Most Influential People on the Internet
* Now there have been countless posts and videos by others, "explaining" the whole theory
  * Views in the 100,000s


#### Theory - "Calm Before the Storm"
First, a quote:  
> Like Pizzagate, the Storm conspiracy features secret cabals, a child sex-trafficking ring led (in part) by the satanic Democratic Party, and of course, countless logical leaps and paranoid assumptions that fail to hold up under the slightest fact-based scrutiny.

* Quick Summary:
  * Trump has a master plan to stage a counter-coup against members of the deep state 
    * "Deep State": a term used to describe permanent, influential decision-making bodies within government

* Longer Summary:
  * QAnon drops little bits of information (pieces of this theory) in the form of "crumbs"
  * Russia
    * Trump was never really involved with Russia
    * Trump is not being investigated by Mueller & Co.
    * Actually, Clinton and Obama were corrupted by Putin
    * Trump knew this when he was just a candidate and he's _pretending_ to have been involved so those two get
      investiagted
 * Clinton & Obama
    * They're both power hungry and pure evil; totally willing to sell out
    * May or may not be into raping killing children, but we're not sure why...
      * CIA blackmail?
      * Satanists?
    * Clinton, Obama, McCain, and others are all either arrested (and wearing ankle bracelets) or about to be arrested
    * The Las Vegas shooting was an inside job connected to the "Saudi-Clinton" cabal
  * Much of this will coalesce soon and "The Storm" will be upon us
    * At this point, there will be many arrested, political turmoil, etc
  * QAnon has found a following in older Trump supporters
    * QAnon followers interpret the clues and call themselves "bakers" (because of "breadcrums" lol)
    * QAnon believes have a slogan: `WWG1WGA`: Where we go on, we go all"
      * It’s become a rallying cry for QAnon fans that Q has attributed to President John F. Kennedy (he didn't say that though)



#### Theories about QAnon
* Why is s/he credible?
  * Apparently predicted Trump would use a particular word in a Tweet
    * "Small" on "Small Business Saturday"
  * Posted blurry photo that looked like it could have been taken from a plane in China, while AF1 was taking Trump to China
* QAnon claims to be a high-level government insider with QAnon clearance (The highest level)
  * Side note, the levels of security clearance are:
    * Confidential
    * Secret
    * L
    * Top Secret
    * Q
* People all have their own theories:
  * White House official?
  * Trump himself?


#### Quotes:
(QAnon posted this in Nov, 2017, so this should have all taken place then)
> Q Clearance Patriot

> My fellow Americans, over the course of the next several days you will undoubtedly realize that we are taking back our great country (the land of the free) from the evil tyrants that wish to do us harm and destroy the last remaining refuge of shining light. On POTUS’ order, we have initiated certain fail-safes that shall safeguard the public from the primary fallout which is slated to occur 11.3 upon the arrest announcement of Mr. Podesta (actionable 11.4). Confirmation (to the public) of what is occurring will then be revealed and will not be openly accepted. Public riots are being organized in serious numbers in an effort to prevent the arrest and capture of more senior public officials. On POTUS’ order, a state of temporary military control will be actioned and special ops carried out. False leaks have been made to retain several within the confines of the United States to prevent extradition and special operator necessity. Rest assured, the safety and well-being of every man, woman, and child of this country is being exhausted in full. However, the atmosphere within the country will unfortunately be divided as so many have fallen for the corrupt and evil narrative that has long been broadcast. We will be initiating the Emergency Broadcast System (EMS) during this time in an effort to provide a direct message (avoiding the fake news) to all citizens. Organizations and/or people that wish to do us harm during this time will be met with swift fury – certain laws have been pre-lifted to provide our great military the necessary authority to handle and conduct these operations (at home and abroad).


> POTUS will be well insulated/protected on AF1 and abroad (specific locations classified) while these operations are conducted due to the nature of the entrenchment. It is time to take back our country and make America great again. Let us salute and pray for the brave men and women in uniform who will undertake this assignment to bring forth peace, unity, and return power to the people.

> It is our hope that this message reaches enough people to make a meaningful impact. We cannot yet telegraph this message through normal methods for reasons I’m sure everyone here can understand. Follow the questions from the previous thread(s) and remain calm, the primary targets are within DC and remain at the top (on both sides). The spill over in the streets will be quickly shut down. Look for more false flags — stay alert, be vigilant, and above all, please pray.

> “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Love is patient, love is kind.”

> God bless my fellow Americans.

> 4,10,20

#### Conclusion
* This is very similar to Pizzagate
* Of course we're going to call this out as BS, BUT my question is:
  * How does shit like this keep happening?
  * Are people really this susceptible to this kind of BS? Why?
  * How can we stop this in the world we live in?
