Pilots
===
* PIC - The Pilot In Command.  Basically the guy legally resonsible if shit goes south.
	* Authorized/capable of flying the plane but might not actually fly it t all
	* They're responsible for the duration of "flight time"
		* Flight time is the time from take off to landing.  Includes taxiing
		* Idk why this needs a special name
		* 
#### Career
* PPL
	* Private Pilot Liscence
* ATPL
	* Airline Transport Pilot Liscence
* Very competitive
* Have to put n YEARS of practice and flight time to even been considered for a good airline
* One professional's quote:
	 * Every airline I've jumpseated on, Alaska, United, UPS etc, all have the worst things to say about their company.
	 * But this industry does tend to jade you, and it's all about attitude and endurance.
	 * You will meet some awesome people along the way, you'll learn ALOT about how to be a better people person and how to keep the peace around a crusty captain. 
	 * You definitely figure out that it's best to just go with the flow and pick your battles.
			 * That alone will make the journey so much easier, until you're captain one day. 
	 * Yeou can make a career; but it takes years, endurance, holidays gone, 3am wake ups and 16 hour days, random faces and same ol airports and hotels, crazy schedules and opinionated people.
#### Stuff you might not know about
* Bleed air - Air drawn from the engines used for A/C
	* "I occasionally get a whiff of JET A2 fueld when we're start the engines"
	* Seems safe!
* Differences between types of pilots:
	* USAF
		* More freedom, listening to music, etc
		* 
	* Or read a newspaper
* On modern fighters the song "Danger Zone" is stored in the flight computer
* Oxygen masks
	* The oxygen systems aboard passenger aircraft are each individual chemical generator oxygen systems. When you grab the mask and pull down....it activates the generator.
	* Your breathing rate has nothing to do with their duration. Oxygen is supplied whether you breathe it or not. If no one is in the seat next to you, use that mask once yours runs out
##### Engineering
* It takes about 5 to 10 years for a product to go from an idea to production for aerospace. 
* And then more time for approvals and buy offs. 
* * By the time a plane is brand new on the tarmac, it's between 15 and 20 years old technologically. 

##### Anecdotes and Memories
* What are your favorite memories?
	* First takeoff in a jet
	* First time landing in snowy Denver.
	* Banging a flight attendant for the first time
	*  Flying over Yosemite at sunset
*  Close calls
	*  Meteor
		*  Copilot: In a 737 cruising Northeast bound over the South China Sea towards Hong Kong when all of the sudden this meteorite blazes past us and hurtles toward the surface of the ocean. 
		*  I think it missed us by only a couple of kilometres. 
		*  And no, we wouldn't have been able to avoid it had it come our way. It was ridiculously fast.
		*  Incorrect directions that cause planes to almost collide in the air or on the tarmac
		*  Joke story:
			*  Not an airline pilot but I regularly fly spoonfuls of food into my son's mouth. The closest call was when I was guiding a spoon of Banana Yogurt early in the morning. I got distracted when I was drinking my go-juice and suddenly the baby had his fangs out and grabbed the spoon, changed the flight-path, and altered the course of the spoon towards his nose where a bogey was trailing. The bogey twisted around and then swooped down on top of the spoon.
It was a bit of a fur-ball until the spoon changed course again and was hurdling at breakneck speed towards the baby's open mouth with some bogey on its tail. I was able to jink the spoon and maneuver away from the mouth and eventually away from the hostile environment and to safety.
He never had a clue what just happened and proceeded to power barf all over the plate.
