	 * Every airline has have the worst things to say about their company.
	 * Industry tends to jade you; it's all about attitude and endurance.
	 * You will meet some awesome people along the way

##### Anecdotes and Memories

    > Retired pilot
        - First takeoff in a jet
        - First time landing in snowy Denver.
        - Banging a flight attendant for the first time
        - Flying over Yosemite at sunset

*  Close calls
    * Lots of close calls on the runway; planes almost crashing
		* Incorrect directions that cause planes to almost collide in the air or on the tarmac

> Copilot
    * In a 737 cruising Northeast bound over the South China Sea towards Hong Kong when all of the sudden this meteorite blazes past us and hurtles toward the surface of the ocean. 
    * I think it missed us by only a couple of kilometres. 
    * And no, we wouldn't have been able to avoid it had it come our way. It was ridiculously fast.

##### Stuff you might not know about
* Bleed air - Air drawn from the engines used for A/C
	* "I occasionally get a whiff of JET A2 fueld when we're start the engines"
	* Seems safe!
* O2
    * The oxygen systems aboard passenger aircraft are each individual chemical generator oxygen systems. When you grab the mask and pull down.  it activates the generator.
    * Your breathing rate has nothing to do with their duration. Oxygen is supplied whether you breathe it or not. If no one is in the seat next to you, use that mask once yours runs out

* On modern fighters the song "Danger Zone" is stored in the flight computer


### Question
* This job sucks in a lot of ways, but people do it because they love it
* This creates camraderie
* Interesting that the job is worth it for so many pilots
