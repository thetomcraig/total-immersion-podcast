History

* Great Reunion of 1912 - celebrating the 50th anniversary

    * Rylan do you know what this is?
  * At night, an impromptu Union raid on the Confederate side of the Great Camp resulted in joint parades and camp fires following the "charge".

Classification
====
* Three categories of reenacters
  * *Farbs*
    * Reenactors who spend relatively little time and/or money achieving authenticity with regard to uniforms, accessories, or period behavior. 
    * Anachronistic clothing, fabrics, fasteners, snoods, footwear, vehicles, and modern cigarettes are common.
      * You better ask me what a snood is
      * A snood is a type of headgear designed to hold the hair in a cloth or yarn bag.
  * *Mainstream*
    * Reenactors who make an effort at appearing authentic, but may come out of character in the absence of an audience.
    * Visible stitches are likely to be sewn in a period-correct manner, but hidden stitches and undergarments may not be period-appropriate.
  * *Progressive*
    * Hard-core authentics, sometimes derisively called "stitch counters"
    * They seek an "immersive" reenacting experience, trying to live, as much as possible, as someone of the 1860s might have. This includes eating seasonally and regionally appropriate food, sewing inside seams and undergarments in a period-appropriate manner, and staying in character throughout an event.
