## Part 1/2 Instagram et. all
### Brand Ambassador
* Person who is hired to represent a brand; show it off
* This person should embody the corporate identity
  * Questlove
* This has been around forever, but w/ internet it's become cheaper and easier for anyone to be an abassador
* Instagram has made it possible to reverse the process
  * Rather than companies picking people like celbrities, individuals can prove themselves (to the brand) worthy of being ambassadors
  * There is an art and a set of rules to doing this
    * Consistently posting quality, relavant, cohesive content
    * Using the right hashtags and descriptions
    * Promoting yourself just enough (name, contact info, etc)
    * Hyrbid promotion (hashtags on business cards, etc)
    * Know your audience and hwo to target sections
    * Join an influencer network
* Influencer Network??
  * These services let you apply to become a brand ambassador
* Once you're on board you have to post in the fashion dictated by the brand/company that's paying you


### Social Media Influencer
* Very similar to Brand Ambassador, but more about swaying large sections of social media users
* Not tie to a specific brand or product or company` w


### Conclusion
* This is whack
* So many new roles and jobes and shit
  * I saw this one on the Bachelorete - `Social Media Participant`


## Part 2/2 - Youtubers
### Industry and world of influencers
* Companies exist to "sign" influencers
  * Maker Studios - "Disney Digital Network"
    * In 2012, became the number one independent YouTube network
    * Most popular production is _Epic Rap Battles of History_
    * In 2014 sold itself to Disney

* Basically anything for views
  * Logan Paul - Suicide Forest
    * He did other shit in Japan too, which was reprehensible
    > In other online video clips, Paul is seen running around the city with dead fish in his hands, thrusting them into the faces of passers-by and rubbing them on car windows.
    > He also buys a game console from a street market, throws it on the floor and demands a refund on the grounds that it is "much-o broken-o". He subsequently dressed up as Pikachu and threw a ball at pedestrians; when police intervened, he threw the ball at them.

### Conclusion
* This has really changed how we view celebrity
  * Anyone can be a celebrity with varying levels of talent
  * Do just about anything for views

* Romantic relationships also changed
  * People/Couples live their lives independently and together online
    * The've got individual brands and their joint brand
    * Breakup videos have become a genre on Youtube
    > Where before partners might consider joining their banking accounts, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge their brands
    * This pertains to everyday people online as well
    >  You donâ€™t have to be a big YouTube star to think about when you make a relationship Instagram official, how much a partner should be mentioned on your social media feeds, or even what labels you publicly use for one another
  * Liza Koshy and David Dobrik
    * Individual and joint brands, broke up and kept it a secret for 6 months
    * Posted a video about the breakup
    * Actaully kind of cool
