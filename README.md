Total Immersion is weekly a podcast in which we immerse ourselves in subcultures, proving we know nothing about anything.  
Every Wednesday morning Tom tells Rylan about a topic he has immersed himself in, and we explore the topic together.  

Join us as we immerse ourselves in the worlds of Freemasons, Botanists, Flat Earth Theorists and more!
